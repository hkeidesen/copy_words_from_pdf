These are iterative processes as the project develops and design matures. Necessary supporting documentation (e.g. studies, analysis and design reviews) shall b e provided with due consideration for timely input to design and procurement processes. Concepts combining a jack -up drilling rig and a fixed installation require special consideration, ref. aspects described in Annex A - Jack -up/jacket constellations. A follow- up system shall be established that enables proper documentation, handling, follow -up and closeout of agreed actions and recommendations from the various studies and analyses in the project. In the event space is allocated for future expansions in new project developments, the design should incorporate sufficient flexibility to include capacity for the additional equipment, e.g. fire water, flare etc. fire water.

The individual project or installat ion shall perform specific hazard identification and risk analysis and evaluation processes. Based on this process, the requirements in this document shall be supplemented as necessary to manage the ris k.
