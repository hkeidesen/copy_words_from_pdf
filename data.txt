These are iterative processes as the project develops and design matures. Necessary supporting documentation (e.g. studies, analysis and design reviews) shall be provided with due consideration for timely input to design and procurement processes. Concepts combining a jack-up drilling rig and a fixed installation require special consideration, ref. aspects described in Annex A - Jack- up\\/jacket constellations.\\n\\nA follow-up system shall be established that enables proper documentation, handling, follow-up and closeout of agreed actions and recommendations from the various studies and analyses in the project.\\n\\nIn the event space is allocated for future expansions in new project developments, the design should incorporate sufficient flexibility to include capacity for the additional equipment, e.g. fire water, flare etc. fire water.\"],[\"5.2  Activities related to technical safety design\",null],[\"5.2.1 Overview\",\"A flow diagram illustrating some of the main activities related to technical safety design is shown in Figure 1. The activities are detailed in the immediate following subclauses. Reference is made to NORSOK Z-013 for details related to risk assessment.\"],[\"5.2.2 Define Context\",\"Context needs to be defined and compiled so that frame conditions, limitations and ambitions for the installation (and its areas and activities) are available for relevant personnel involved in technical safety issues or technical safety management. Examples of context are legislation, standards (internal\\/ external), concept decisions, operating conditions, prerequisites for use, assumptions\\/ requirements and\\n \\n\\n\\ndemands to risk reduction. The context applied for the management of technical safety has to be traceable and documented.\\n\\nA major part of the context will be defined early in the development of an installation. During the installation life cycle the context will provide a basis for use\\/ reassessment and it need to be updated to ensure that all relevant changes and modifications are included.\"],[\"5.2.3 Identify hazards and accidental events (HAZID)\",\"The starting point for the risk assessment is to identify hazards and their accidental events that are relevant for the design and operation of the installation.\\n\\nWithin management of technical safety, various hazard identifications need to be performed. The structure of HAZIDs should preferably be area based, but for some cases they may also be a HAZID node (e.g. part of well, process or utility systems), phase or operational based.\\n\\nBased on hazard identifications it shall be possible to present an overview of possible hazards and accidental events that can occur in different areas and during different activities. The level of detail and depth of hazard identification will be dependent of the maturity of the projects.\"],[\"5.2.4 Perform risk analyses and evaluations\",\"Risk and safety analyses \\/ studies shall be performed to establish sufficiently detailed information about the risk associated with the identified hazards and accidental events. The information will be used to evaluate the risk and to decide which solutions (barriers), and related requirements that are needed for preventing, controlling and mitigating the hazards in addition to generic requirements given by the context.\\n\\nEvaluation of risk includes an assessment of:\\n\\n- compliance with predefined evaluation criteria (e.g. minimum requirements and acceptance criteria in context);\\n- necessary ALARP processes to demonstrate that risk has been reduced to a level as low as reasonably practicable;\\n- uncertainties associated with the hazards, accidental events and their consequences as well as the risk reducing effect of the barriers.\\n\\nThe results from risk analyses are used for many purposes. One is to provide information and decision support related to the need for and role of risk reducing measures (barriers) and their required performance. Another is to provide decision support regarding the risk level assessed and if this is considered acceptable for the facility. Reference is made to subclause 5.10 for examples of studies and evaluations.\\n\\nFor a development project, the degree of details in the risk and safety analyses \\/ studies will increase as the project matures through different phases. Thus, solutions, assumptions and conservative estimates typically used in early stages may be verified or changed due to more detailed analyses.\"],[\"5.2.5 Identify and define barrier functions, systems and elements (risk treatment)\",\"The need for barrier functions shall be established based on the context, identified hazards and accidental events, risk analyses and risk evaluation activities. Documentation shall be prepared so that it is possible to identify the need for barrier functions in each installation area or relevant HAZID node.\\n\\nWhen the need for barrier functions are identified, systems and elements necessary for realizing the barrier functions shall be defined.\\n \\n\\n\\nTechnical barriers often require some form of monitoring, control or activation by people to function as intended. Depending on the characteristics of the facility and its risk picture, different levels of automation may also be chosen for certain safety systems. Therefore, operational and emergency situation considerations shall be an integral part of technical barrier process. As part of project development, safety system design shall include a human factors study amongst others documenting the following:\\n\\n- Identification of safety critical tasks (\\u201coperational barrier elements\\u201d) required for the safety system to function. These include tasks related to start-up, monitoring, operation, incident response and recovery in the event of technical failure.\\n- Description of performance requirements. These include who is responsible for performing a task, under what circumstances it is expected to be performed, available response time and how it shall be carried out.\\n\\nThe results from the study shall be used as input to design, as well as preparations for operations. Input to design should include HMI and alarm system specifications, levels of automation, equipment labelling, system capacities and tolerances.\\n\\nThis standard focuses on technical design requirements and addresses operational and organizational aspects supplementing the technical barriers.\"],[\"5.2.6 Safety strategies\",\"Documentation shall be prepared to record how specific hazards or accidental events are managed by the use of barrier functions, systems and elements. This documentation can be denoted the 'safety strategy\\u2019 (or \\u2018the barrier strategy\\u2019) and can replace the need for Fire and Explosion Strategy (FES) and the Escape, Evacuation and Rescue Strategy (EER strategy) as required by ISO 13702.\\n\\nSafety strategies do not necessarily need to be described in a single document. The strategy may be described and included in other relevant documentation where this is natural and appropriate. The need to develop separate strategies can be viewed in relation to the other documentation which exists or is prepared for the individual facility.\\n\\nSafety strategy documentation should also be prepared to outline applicable overall principles for design, layout, arrangement, philosophies and other high-level design and operational aspects related to barriers; e.g.:\\n\\n- how different safety documentation are linked together;\\n- risk reduction principles - inherent safety design;\\n- premises for design;\\n- design provisions for the operating phase;\\n- accidental loads and resistance.\"],[\"5.2.7 Define performance requirements\",\"Verifiable performance requirements shall be established to ensure that the barrier function is fulfilled. In some situations, performance requirements can also be set directly to barrier functions. Performance requirements shall be established as an integrated part of the design and construction process, as the decisions on what safety systems and barriers to install and their corresponding specifications are made.\\n\\nPerformance requirement (PR) for technical barrier elements can be divided into the following categories:\\n\\n-Functionality i.e. the ability of the barrier or barrier element to execute the objectives (intended role) affecting the progress of an accident, e.g. by ensuring capacity and effectiveness. The\\n minimum functional requirement of barrier\\/barrier element is often given by regulations, referred standards and company internal requirements. However, the specific safety strategy can call for stricter or more nuanced requirements.\\n-Integrity of the barrier\\/barrier element, i.e. the barrier \\/ barrier element\\u2019s ability to be present when needed (reliability and availability). These requirements can be determined based on specific safety analysis-\\/studies or the implementation of generic minimum requirements. The following general requirements apply:\\n-Design and realisation, inclusive of relevant operating issues, of all safety instrumented systems (SIS) shall be based upon the principles of IEC 61508\\/IEC 61511. The minimum requirements presented in Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070 may be used instead of a full safety analysis\\/risk assessment for standardised solutions.\\n-The applicable safety system, or affected parts of it, shall be designed to fail-to-safe principle, whereby the system goes to a predefined safe state in the event of detectable malfunction. It shall be designed with the aim of avoiding single defects \\/ failures that may prohibit safety actions being executed. If it is not feasible to implement a fail-to-safe principle, an equivalent level of safety shall be achieved by redundancy and\\/or diagnostics and fault alarm to relevant manned control room.\\n-The probability of single defects \\/ failures causing inadvertent trip actions shall be as low as reasonably practicable (e.g. provide fault tolerance by means of automatic diagnostic features and redundancy).\\n-All barriers or parts thereof, shall be protected against or withstand environmental conditions that may compromise their safety functions, e.g. ice, snow, sand, water, etc.\\n- Survivability of the barrier\\/barrier element, i.e. its ability to function under relevant accident scenarios and loads. Equipment with a safety function, during and after the accident, should be located so that the possible impact from accidental loads is minimised. To develop the survivability requirements, the design loads that shall form the basis for design of facilities, systems and equipment need to be determined, ref. subclause 5.6 Accidental loads and resistance.\\n\\nBarriers\\/safety systems may be dependent on safety critical tasks to function, through e.g. monitoring, activation or control. For relevant safety systems, performance requirements should also be defined for operational \\/ organizational barrier elements, ref. subclause 5.4.\\n\\nEach clause of this document from clause 6 and onwards describes generic design principles and requirements for the different safety systems and barriers. The installation specific performance requirements shall be developed based on this framework to manage the risk.\"],[\"5.2.8 Define performance Standards\",\"It may be beneficial to group the various performance requirements into performance standards including a description of the role of the safety functions. Dependencies on and interfaces with other systems should also be described.\"],[\"5.2.9 Establish safety requirement specifications (SRS)\",\"A Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) is a documentation of requirements related to safety instrumented systems (SIS). The SRS documentation shall be developed during projects and shall provide the design basis for required SIS.\\n\\nGenerally, the SRS shall contain the relevant key information for use in specifying and operating the instrumented safety functions. However, the information required may be contained in other project documents referred to in the SRS, e.g. performance standards. Duplication of information should be avoided.\\n\\nThe SRS shall contain three main types of requirements:\\n \\n\\n\\n- functional requirements such as capacities and response times,\\n-integrity requirements such as PFD and SIL, and,\\n-operating prerequisites and constraints.\\n\\nFurther reference is given to IEC 61511 (Functional Safety \\u2013 Safety Instrumented Systems for the process industry sector\\u201d) and Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070.\"],[\"5.2.10 Safety specifications, diagrams, drawings, philosophies, etc.\",\"Documentation that needs to be developed to deepen or clarify performance requirements when necessary. Ref. subclause 5.10 Documentation. Also, see Annex C for proposed format and information for data sheets for selected Safety Equipment.\"],[\"5.3 Risk reduction principles and inheret safety design\",\"In concept development, priority shall be given to solutions that are inherently safe. If the hazard cannot be eliminated, probability reducing measures should be given priority over consequence reducing measures.\\n\\nThe objectives of risk reduction principles and inherent safety design are to:\\n\\n-eliminate or reduce potential hazards\\/increase inherent safety by;\\n-reduction, e.g. reducing the hazardous inventories or the frequency or duration of exposure;\\n-substitution, e.g. substituting hazardous materials with less hazardous ones;\\n-attenuation (moderation), e.g. using the hazardous materials or processes in a way that limits their hazard potential;\\n-simplifications, e.g. making the facility and process simpler to design, build and operate, hence less prone to equipment, control and human failure;\\n-reduce probability of hazardous events;\\n-establish mitigating measures, e.g. through safety barriers.\\n\\nThe ALARP principle (As Low As Reasonable Practicable) shall be used to select the safety solutions.\"],[\"5.4 Design provisions for the operating phase\",\"Effective management of technical barriers in project development and design processes also need to address relevant dependencies with operational and organizational aspects for the operating phase. Some examples of interfaces between technical, operational and organizational aspects to be considered are:\\n\\n-operational prerequisites for start-up and use;\\n-measures and restrictions that are necessary in the event of overriding, disconnection or in the event of missing\\/impaired safety systems and barriers;\\n-maintenance;\\n-competence;\\n-emergency preparedness;\\n-manual intervention.\\n\\nIn order to ensure solutions which are suited for varying conditions, particular prerequisites shall be accommodated for in the design phase (and sustained during the operating phase). Examples of aspects that should be addressed are:\\n\\n-assumptions including conditions and possible actions, when operating in different modes, i.e. normal, test, fault, failure, degraded. (Relevant assumptions in risk analyses should be according to requirements in the different installation specific performance standards);\\n \\n\\n\\n-provisions, routines and logs for isolation of safety related functions during testing and maintenance, e.g. by inhibit (disabling input signal) and override (disabling output action). Such isolation should not render unnecessarily large parts of the system inactive. Logging, manual or automatic, of any such isolation action, e.g. time, number and duration, is mandatory;\\n-requirements for compensatory measures. (Responsible personnel for the operating phase will need to implement the necessary measures to remedy or compensate for non-conformities, missing or impaired barriers).\\n\\nThe basis for inspection, testing and maintenance shall be described as part of project development in close liaison with the end user and be finalized before start-up. Important elements are:\\n\\n-Systems, equipment and barriers shall be classified as regards the health, safety and environment consequences of potential functional failures. Information in performance standards shall regardless of other criticality analyses (e.g. according to NORSOK Z-008) be used as basis for categorizing safety critical equipment.\\n-An inspection-, testing- and maintenance programme for safety barriers shall be developed as part of project development. The programme should include test\\/inspection\\/maintenance methods and intervals. These shall be determined based upon regulatory requirements, company requirements, performance requirements, results\\/assumptions from analyses (e.g. SIL), criticality analysis (ref NORSOK Z-008), manufacturers\\u2019 recommendations, operating experience and relevant plant maintenance strategy. For instrumented safety systems, also see Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070. For structures, see NORSOK N-005.\\n-The safety functions\\/systems should, where reasonably practicable, allow for the required testing to be carried out without interrupting production or operations.\\n-Systems shall be established for monitoring barrier integrity, including possible deficiencies and degradation. The system should be established and populated with data during commissioning.\"],[\"5.5 Commissioning and start-up\",\"Safety management during installation, start-up and the operating phases shall be defined in specific commissioning and operating procedures. This includes activity requirements and descriptions addressing:\\n\\n-installation and commissioning manuals;\\n-start-up procedures.\\n\\nVerifying that relevant barrier elements meet all the specified performance requirements is the main objective in the commissioning phase. The commissioning test shall be performed under as realistic operating conditions as possible. Some tests, e.g. depressurisation systems or hydraulic power for ESD systems may have to be put through final capacity testing shortly after operations have started.\\n\\nThe fire water system shall be subject to full scale dimensioning fire water demand scenario test, i.e. simultaneous release of all deluge skids covering the largest and largest neighbouring fire area.\\n\\nRelevant experience from commissioning and start-up shall be transferred to the operational phase.\\n\\nSafety related systems\\/functions required for safe project execution shall be operational to reflect the risk when the facility is gradually moved from construction to full operational status. Systems required for life support, communication, evacuation, fire detection, active and passive fire protection shall be operational when the facility is to be inhabited.\"],[\"5.6 Accidental loads and resistance\",null],[\"5.6.1 General\",\"The accidental loads\\/actions that can affect facilities or parts of facilities shall be determined. Also, the design loads that shall form basis for design and operation of facilities, systems and equipment need to be determined. Determination of design loads shall ensure that both deterministic and functional requirements in applicable regulations are met. The chosen design accidental loads that are to be used as basis for design shall ensure that facilities, systems and equipment are designed in such a way that relevant accidental situations will not result in unacceptable consequences.\\n\\nIn addition to loads described in the subsequent sections, the following loads shall be included (ref. NORSOK N-003 Actions and action effects and NORSOK Z-013 Risk and emergency preparedness analysis);\\n\\n- swinging\\/falling loads (e.g. impact loads to be absorbed without critical damage including subsea pipeline, risers and equipment),\\n-ship collisions (e.g. impact loads to be absorbed without critical damage including effects on wells and risers), and\\n-extreme environmental loads.\\n\"],[\"5.6.2 Gas explosions\",\"Explosion loads from ignited gas clouds are strongly dependent on factors such as:\\n\\n-cloud size and gas concentration;\\n-gas type;\\n-confinement and\\/or congestion of the affected area;\\n-explosion relief solutions;\\n-ignition location.\\n\\nDesign explosion loads shall be established using a recognised method (e.g. NORSOK Z-013) and a representative geometric explosion model with representative equipment density.\\n\\nIt is recognized that in the initial design the detail arrangement may not have been developed. An explosion study should be performed at an early stage, enabling the key installation parts to be located favorably with regard to explosion. The methods and detailing of the input will reflect this situation.\\nExplosion loads shall be defined for relevant horizontal and vertical area dividers (pressure and impulse from explosion) and relevant equipment (pressure\\/drag forces). Explosion loads shall also be defined for areas external to the initial explosion location (typical LQ, utility modules etc.) if applicable.\\n\\nEquipment that can become a flying object and can significantly impair critical safety equipment\\/structures such as fire divisions, riser valves, wellheads, blowdown piping, should be considered secured. Examples of such equipment are well hatches, panels, temporary equipment, etc.\"],[\"5.6.3 Hydrocarbon fire\",null],[\"5.6.3.1 General\",\"The heat load from hydrocarbon fires is strongly dependent on:\\n\\n-hydrocarbon composition and fire type (gas, liquid, jet, liquid spray or pool fire);\\n-fire size (optical thickness, velocity, turbulence and heat loss);\\n-geometry and ventilation conditions (turbulence, fuel\\/ventilation controlled, preheating of air, heat loss).\"],[\"5.6.3.2 Main load bearing structure\",\"For main load bearing structures, the heat load distribution is of great importance. A validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model shall be used to provide realistic modelling of the fire source and the effect of the surroundings in order to define the design accidental load. Care shall be taken when selecting simulation cases. Either these shall be selected and used conservatively, or a larger number of simulations are necessary to be statistically representative.\"],[\"5.6.3.3 Worst credible process fire\",\"The worst credible process fire (WCPF) in a fire area is derived from an ignited leak in the ESD-segment including possible escalation that will give the worst exposure of main load bearing structures and fire divisions with regard to duration (not related to the time needed for safe evacuation) and heat load distribution. ESD valves and emergency depressurization valves limiting the supply of fuel can be assumed to function. With respect to liquid spills, the open drain or grating in the area can be taken into account.\\n\\nThe load from the WCPF shall be covered by the design accidental load for main load bearing structures and fire divisions. The identified WCPF shall not escalate to hydrocarbon pipeline risers or to wells (flow from reservoir) to avoid impairment of the main load bearing structures.\\n\\nTypical relevant scenarios would be:\\n\\n1)\\ta fire from the liquid segment giving the longest duration above critical rate related to main load bearing structures and fire divisions;\\n2)\\ta jet fire from the largest gas EDP segment escalating to item 1 above.\\n\\nRelevant segments to be considered for WCPF are topside process segments limited by ESD valves.

The duration is dependent on ESD segment size and content, time to shutdown, time to start depressurisation, depressurisation rate and leak rate.\\n\\nWhen calculating if and when process segments will rupture due to jet fire exposure due to material weakening, the heat exposure from a leak should be evaluated by assessing two representative points in the fire as follows:\\n\\n\\uf0be\\tPoint 1: Using the maximum duration of a leak rate from any ESD segment in the area above 2 kg\\/s as the duration with local peak heat load of 350 kW\\/m2 (representing a point at some distances from the leak).\\n\\uf0be\\tPoint 2: Using the maximum duration of a leak rate above 0,1 kg\\/s as the duration with local peak heat load of 250 kW\\/m2 (representing a point close to the leak).\\n\\nNOTE\\tFor calculation purposes it is assumed that the equipment has not been exposed to heat loads from point 1.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2 \\u2014 Jet fire calculation\\n\\nThe same principle applies for pool fires, but with different fire loads, ref.

Analysis regarding material capacity versus EDP should be performed as specified in \\u201cGuidelines for protection of pressurised systems exposed to fire\\u201d, Report 27.101.166\\/R1 Scandpower Risk Management AS [2] or similar methods. Reference is also made to subclause 5.6.3.4.\\n\\nThe following aspects shall be considered in the design process:\\n\\n\\uf0be\\tdamage to internals of equipment (e.g. trays, packing supports), entrainment of packing or catalyst into the depressurization system;\\n\\uf0be\\tthe depressurisation rates shall be maximized within a defined level of flare system utilisation to reduce risk further and minimize the need for passive fire protection. 100 % utilisation is normal. For some installations, the flare system capacity may be very large due to relief cases like choke collapse and mal-operation of inlet valves. Then a lower utilisation of the flare system for emergency depressurisation may be correct since this will reduce noise, radiation and pipe stress at depressurization.\\n\\nFailure of a segregation valve impacting EDP segments shall not result in overpressure of the flare system.\\n\\nIn case sequential EDP is required, the time delay and\\/or sequence to open EDP valves shall ensure that the flare system capacity is not exceeded and failure in the sequence shall not lead to rupture of the flare system. However, exceeding the radiation levels due to failure in sequence may be acceptable provided that the escape from exposed work areas are not impaired. Reference is also given to API STD 521.\\n\\nThe EDP valves shall be treated similarly to ESD valves with respect to logic, tagging, response time etc. except local manual reset. The EDP valves shall be equipped with position indication (remote and local) and have fail-safe open function.\\n\\nThe objective is generally to avoid shut in volumes without EDP, and to minimize their volumes by proper location of valves. All pressure vessels and piping segments, which during shutdown contain more than\\n \\n\\n\\n1 000 kg of hydrocarbons (liquid and\\/or gaseous), shall be equipped with a depressurising system. For pressure vessels and piping segments without a depressurising system, containing gas or unstabilised oil with a high gas\\/oil-ratio, the maximum containment should be considerably lower, typically less than\\n100 kg. Segments in this context mean volumes that are isolated by automatic shutdown valves (PSD\\/ESD valves) and non-return valves or control valves.\\n\\nA blowdown orifice may act as a weir. Liquid that may accumulate between the EDP valve and the orifice shall not freeze.\\n\\nBlock valves in EDP lines shall be secured open.\\n\\nAll process segments without EDP shall be clearly marked on the P&IDs.\"],[\"12.4.2 Activation of emergency depressurisation (EDP)\",\"EDP shall be automatically initiated upon confirmed fire detection in hazardous areas (process, riser and wellhead areas), on fire and gas detection in riser and wellhead areas and on gas detection when deluge is activated (a gas leak is almost impossible to locate when deluge is released). Any delay of opening of EDP valves shall be accounted for in evaluations of rupture of process equipment due to fire exposure.\\n\\nFull platform depressurisation shall be possible in CCR (operator station and dedicated push button\\nin CAP). Manual push buttons shall be protected against inadvertent activation, e.g. protective covers. Use of the dedicated push buttons shall also initiate ESD2.\\n\\nAutomatic EDP at confirmed gas detection shall be evaluated as a mean to limit extent and duration of possible gas leaks. This will reduce ignition probability, and in case of an ignition, also the probability for rupture of process equipment.\"],[\"12.4.3 Flare, vent and knock out drum\",\"Reference is made to NORSOK P-002 Process System Design with respect to flare, vent and knock out drum requirements.\\n\\nFlare:\\n\\nFlare shall be located and designed to ensure that the heat radiation level at maximum or continually release rate will be within acceptable limits in all areas of the installation. The permissible radiation levels for personnel exposure shall be in accordance with API STD 521. Consideration should be made to effect of clothing.\\n\\nCold and local vents:\\n\\nVents shall be terminated at a safe location, normally verified by gas dispersion simulations. Operational conditions that may give gas heavier than air shall be included.\\n\\nGas concentrations from vents (or extinguished flare) shall not exceed 20 % LEL in any area on the installation where ignition of the release is possible. Helicopter flight paths shall be optimized and based on dispersion studies of release from extinguished flares, ref. CAP 437 \\u201cStandards for Offshore Helicopter Landing\\u201d regarding LEL levels and management system for alerting helicopter pilots.\\n\\nUnintentional ignition of the vents shall not give unacceptable heat loads.\\n\\nLocal venting of hazardous gases should not be permitted unless it can be done without hazard to the personnel (including occupational health) or the installation.\"],[\"12.5 Survivability requirements\",\"The flare system shall withstand explosions and fires for the required period of time to minimum maintain integrity to avoid unacceptable rupture, ref. subclause 5.6.3.4.

Dispersion studies should be performed for verification and optimization of location and number of detectors.\\n\\nThe detector grid coverage described above may be optimized, typically in wellhead and process areas, possibly achieving a reduction in no of detectors, by applying the following method and target:\\n\\nTarget: A gas cloud equal to the volume of the dimensioning gas cloud (explosion loads) shall be detected with a 95 % probability for confirmed detection on two detectors.
