NORSOK is an acronym for the competitive position of the Norwegian contin
ental shelf and comprise 
petroleum industry standards in Norway. The collaboration initiative in 1993 between the authorities 
and the petroleum industry initiated the development of NORSOK standards.
 Reducing the project execution time and developing and operating cost for petroleum installations on the 

Norwegian shelf was the target.
 The intention for the Petroleum industry is to develop and use standards providing good technical and 
cost effective solutions to ensure that the petroleum resources are exploited and managed in the best 
possible way by the industry and the authorities. The industry will actively contribute to the development 
and use of international standards in the global market.
 The NORSOK standards shall:
  bridge the gap based on experiences
 from the Norwegian continental shelf where the international 
standards are unsatisfactorily;
  replace oil company specifications where possible;
  be available as references for the authorities™ regulations;
  be cost effective; and
  promote the Norwegian secto
r as an attractive area for investments and activities.
 Developing new NORSOK standards and regular maintenance of existing standards shall contribute to 
maintain the competitiveness both nationally and internationally for the Norwegian petroleum industry.
 The NORSOK standards are developed by experts from the Norwegian petroleum industry and approved 
according to the consensus principles as laid down by the guidelines given in 
NORSOK A
-001 N
 directive.
 The NORSOK standards are owned by the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, the Federation of 

Norwegian Industries and the Norwegian Shipowners' Association. They are managed and published by 
Standards Norw
ay.
 Annex A is normative, Annex B and Annex C are informative

 xi Introduction
 This NORSOK standard is organised according to principles given in Clause 
5. Each clause of this NORSOK 
standard describes requirements for the individ
ual safety barriers/
-systems, and represents a generic 
performance standard for the different safety barriers. The following elements have been addressed for 
each safety barrier/
-system:
  role gives a short description of the safety aspects related to the specific safety systems and 
barriers; 
 interfaces lists the interface with other safety systems and barriers;
  required utilities describes utilities required for the safety system and barriers to fulfil its role;
  functional requirements specifies the perform
ance required for the safety system and barriers to 

fulfil its role;
  survivability requirements defines requirements for the safety systems and barriers to function in 

or after a design accidental event

 5 Management of technical safety
 5.1 General
 Technical safety management (loss prevention) in project development comprises activities to identify 
risks and to devel
op and document safety strategies and performance requirements for safety systems 
and barriers. These are iterative processes as the project develops and design matures. Necessary 

supporting documentation (e.g. studies, analysis and design reviews) shall b
e provided with due 
consideration for timely input to design and procurement processes. Concepts combining a jack
-up 
drilling rig and a fixed installation require special consideration, ref. aspects 
described in 
Annex 
A - 
Jack
-up/jacket constellations.
 A follow-
up system shall be established that enables proper documentation, handling, follow
-up and 
closeout of agreed actions and recommendations from the various studies and analyses in the project.
 In the event space is allocated for future expansions in new project developments, the design should 

incorporate sufficient flexibility to include capacity for the additional equipment, e.g. fire water, flare etc.
 fire water.

 For modification projects (e.g. upgrading of existing installation/module, tie
-in of sate
llite field), technical 
safety management activities adjusted to project scope and complexity shall be performed, including new 
analyses or updating of existing analyses for factors that are affected by the modification.
 The individual project or installat
ion shall perform specific hazard identification and risk analysis and 
evaluation processes. Based on this process, the requirements in this document shall be supplemented as 

necessary to manage the ris
k.

Activities related to technical safety design
  Define context
 Context needs to be defined and compiled so that frame conditions, limitations and ambitions for the 
installation (and its areas and activities) are available 
for relevant personnel involved in technical safety 
issues or technical safety management. Examples of context are legislation, standards (internal/ 
external), concept decisions, operating conditions, prerequisites for use, assumptions/ requirements and

 de
mands to risk reduction. The context applied for the management of technical safety has to be traceable 
and documented. 
 A major part of the context will be defined early in the development of an installation. During the 
installation life cycle the context
 will provide a basis for use/ reassessment and it need to be updated to 
ensure that all relevant changes and modifications are included.
  Identify hazards and accidental events (HAZID)
 The starting point for the risk assessment is to identify hazards and t
heir accidental events that are 
relevant for the design and operation of the installation. 
 Within management of technical safety, various hazard identifications need to be performed. The 
structure of HAZIDs should preferably be area based, but for some cases they may also be a HAZID node 
(e.g. part of well, process or utility systems), phase or operational based. 
 Based on hazard identifications it shall be possible to present an overview of possible hazards and 

accidental events that can occur in different areas and during different activities. The level of detail and 
depth of hazard identification will be dependent of the maturity of the projects.
  Perform risk analyses and evaluations 
 Risk and safety analyses / studies shall be performed to establish suf
ficiently detailed information 
about 
the risk associated with the identified hazards and accidental events. The information will be used to 

evaluate the risk and to decide which solutions (barriers), and related requirements that are needed for 
preventing,
 controlling and mitigating the hazards in addition to generic requirements give
n by the 
context.
 Evaluation of risk includes an assessment of:
  compliance 
with predefined evaluation criteria (e.g. minimum requirements and acceptance 
criteria in context)
; 
 necessary 
ALARP processes to demonstrate that risk has been reduced to a level as low as 
reasonably practicable
;  
 uncertainties associated with the hazards, accidental events and their consequences as well as the 
risk reducing effect of the barriers. 
 The r
esults from risk analyses are used for many purposes. One is to provide information and decision 
support related to the need for and role of risk reducing measures (barriers) and their required 

performance. Another is to provide decision support regarding 
the risk level assessed and if this is 
considered acceptable for the facility. Reference is made to sub
clause 
5.10
 for examples of studies and 
evaluations.
 For a development project, the degree of details in the
 risk and safety analyses / studies will increase as 
the project matures through different phases. Thus, solutions, assumptions and conservative estimates 

typically used in early stages may be verified or changed due to more detailed analyses. 
  Identify and define barrier functions, systems and elements (risk treatment)
 The need for barrier functions shall be established based on the context, identified hazards and accidental 
events, risk analyses and risk evaluation activities. Documentation shall be prepa
red so that it is possible 
to identify the need for barrier functions in each installation area or relevant HAZID node.
 When the need for barrier functions are identified, systems and elements necessary for realizing the 

barr
ier functions shall be defined.

 Technical barriers often require some form of monitoring, control or activation by people to function as 
intended. Depending on the characteristics of the facility and its risk picture, different levels of 
automation may also be chosen for certain safety systems. Therefore, operational and emergency 

situation considerations shall
 be an integral part of technical barrier process. As part of project 
development, safety system design shall include a human factors study amongst others documenting the 

following
: 
 Identification of safety critical tasks (ﬁoperational barrier elementsﬂ) required for the safety system 

to function. These include tasks related to start
-up, monitoring, operation, incident response and 
recovery in the event of technical failure.
  Descrip
tion of performance requirements. These include who is responsible for performing a task, 
under what circumstances it is expected to be performed, available response time and how it shall 

be carried out.
 The results from the study shall be used as input to
 design, as well as preparations for operations. Input 
to design should include HMI and alarm system specifications, levels of automation, equipment labelling, 
system capacities and tolerances.
 This standard focuses on technical design requirements and add
resses operational and organizational 
aspects supplementing the technical barriers.
  Safety strategies
 Documentation shall be prepared to record how specific hazards or accidental events are managed by the 

use of barrier functions, systems and elements. This documentation can be denoted the 'safety strategy™ 
(or ‚the barrier strategy™) and can replace the need for Fire and Explosion Strategy (FES) and the Escape, 
Evacuation and Rescue Strategy (EER strategy) as required by ISO 13702.
 Safety strategies do not
 necessarily need to be described in a single document. The strategy may be 
described and included in other relevant documentation where this is natural and appropriate. The need 

to develop separate strategies can be viewed in relation to the other documen
tation which exists or is 
prepared for the individual facility.
 Safety strategy documentation should also be prepared to outline applicable overall principles for design, 

layout, arrangement, philosophies and other 
high
-level
 design and operational aspects
 related to barriers; 
e.g.
: 
 how 
different safety documentation are linked together
; 
 risk 
reduction principles 
- 
inherent safety design
; 
 premises 
for design
; 
 design 
provisions for the operating phase
; 
 accidental 
loads and resistance.
  Define
 performance requirements
 Verifiable performance requirements shall be established to ensure that the barrier function is fulfilled. In 
some situations,
 performance requirements can also be set directly to barrier functions. Performance 
requirements shall be established as
 an integrated part of the design and construction process, as the 
decisions on what safety systems and barriers to install and their corresponding specifications are made.
 Performance requirement (PR) for technical barrier elements can be divided
 into the
 following 
categories:
  Functionality 
i.e.
 the ability of the barrier or barrier element to execute the objectives (intended 
role) affecting the progress of an accident, e.g. by ensuring capacity and effectiveness. The 
NORSOK S-001:2018 provided by Standard Online AS for DNV GL Group Companies 2018-06-21NORSOK S

 13
 minimum functional requirement of barr
ier/barrier element is often given by regulations, referred 
standards and company internal requirements.
 However, the specific safety strategy can call for 
stricter or more nuanced requirements.
  Integrity 
of the barrier/barrier element, i.e. the barrier / barrier element™s ability to be present 
when needed (reliability and availability). These requirements can be determined based on specific 
safety analysis
-/studies or the implementation of generic minimum requirements. The following 
general requirements ap
ply:
 o Design and realisation, inclusive of relevant operating issues, of all safety instrumented 
systems (SIS) shall be based upon the principles of IEC 61508/
IEC 
61511. The minimum 
requirements presented in Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070 may be us
ed instead 
of a full safety analysis/risk assessment for standardised sol
utions.
 o The applicable safety system, or affected parts of it, shall be designed to fail
-to-safe 
principle, whereby the system goes to a predefined safe state in the event of detectab
le 
malfunction. It shall be designed with the aim of avoiding single defects / failures that may 

prohibit safety actions being executed. If it is not feasible to implement a fail
-to-safe 
principle, an equivalent level of safety shall be achieved by redunda
ncy and/or diagnostics 
and fault alarm to relevant manned control room.
 o The probability of single defects / failures causing inadvertent trip actions shall be as low as 

reasonably practicable (e.g. provide fault tolerance by means of automatic diagn
ostic 
features and redundancy).
 o All barriers or parts thereof, shall be protected against or withstand environmental 
conditions that may compromise their safety functions, e.g. ice, snow, sand, water, etc.
  Survivability 
of the barrier/barrier element, i.e. its ab
ility to function under relevant accident 
scenarios and loads. Equipment with a safety function, during and after the accident, should be 
located so that the possible impact from accidental loads is minimised. To develop the survivability 
requirements, the
 design loads that shall form the basis for design of facilities, systems and 
equipment need to be determined, ref. subclause 
5.6
 Accidental loads and resistance.
 Barriers/safety systems may be dependent on safe
ty critical tasks to function, through e.g. monitoring, 
activation or control. For relevant safety systems, performance requirements should also be defined for 

operational / organizational barrier elements, r
ef. subclause 
5.4
. 
Each clause of this document from clause 
6 and onwards describes generic design principles and 

requirements for the different safety systems and barriers. The installation specific performance 

requirements shall be developed ba
sed on thi
s framework to manage the risk.
  Define 
performance Standards
 It may be beneficial to group the various performance requirements into performance standards 

including a description of the role of the safety functions. Dependencies on and interfaces
 with other 
systems should also be described.
  Establish 
safety 
requirement 
specification (SRS)
 A Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) is a documentation of requirements related to safety 
instrumented systems (SIS). The SRS documentation shall be develope
d during projects and shall provide 
the design basis for required SIS.
 Generally, the SRS shall contain the relevant key information for use in specifying and operating the 

instrumented safety functions. However, the information required may be contained i
n other project 
documents referred to in the SRS, e.g. performance standards. Duplication of information should be 

avoided.
 The SRS shall contain three main types of requirements:

necessary. Ref. subclause

Also, see 
Annex
 C
 for proposed format and information for 
data sheets for selected Safety Equipment.
 5.3 Risk reduction principles and inherent safety design
 In concept development, priority shall be given to solutions that are inherently safe.
 If the hazard cannot 
be eliminated, probability reducing measures should be given priority over
 consequence reducing 
measures.
 The objectives of risk reduction principles and inherent safety design are to:
  eliminate 
or reduce potential hazards/inc
rease inherent safety by;
  reduction
, e.g. reducing the hazardous inventories or the frequency or duration of exposure
; 
 substitution
, e.g. substituting hazardous materials with less hazardous ones
; 
 attenuation 
(moderation), e.g. using the hazardous material
s or processes in a way that limits their 
hazard potential
; 
 simplifications
, e.g. making the facility and process simpler to design, build and operate, hence less 
prone to equipment, control and human failure
;  reduce 
probability of hazardous events
; 
 establ
ish 
mitigating measures, e.g. through safety barriers.
 The ALARP principle (As Low As Reasonable Practicable) shall be used 
to select the safety solutions.
 5.4 Design provisions for the operating phase
 Effective management of technical barriers in project development and design processes also need to 

address relevant dependencies with operational and organizational aspects for the operating phase. Some 
examples of interfaces between technical, operational and organizational aspects to be considered are:
  operati
onal 
prerequisites for start
-up and use
; 
 measures 
and restrictions that are necessary in the event of overriding, disconnection or in the 
event of missing/impaired safety systems and barriers
; 
 maintenance
; 
 competence;
  emergency 
preparedness; 
 manual 
intervention.
 In order to ensure solutions which are suited for varying conditions, particular prerequisites shall be 
accommodated for in the design phase (and sustained during the operating phase). Examples of aspects 
that should be addressed are:
  assumptions in
cluding conditions and possible actions, when operating in different modes, i.e. 
normal, test, fault, failure, degraded. (Relevant assumptions in risk analyses should be according to 
requirements in the different installation specific performance standards
);

  provisions
, routines and logs for isolation of safety related functions during testing and 
maintenance, e.g. by inhibit (disabling input signal) and override (disabling output action). Such 
isolation should not render unnecessarily large parts of the sy
stem inactive. Logging, manual or 
automatic, of any such isolation action, e.g. time, number and duration, is mandatory
; 
 requirements 
for compensatory measures. (Responsible personnel for the operating phase will 
need to implement the necessary measures to
 remedy or compensate for non
-conformities, missing 
or impaired barriers).
 The basis for inspection, testing and maintenance shall be described as part of project development in 

close liaison with the end user and be finalized before start
-up. Important elements are:
  Systems, equipment and barriers shall be classified as regards the health, safety and environment 

consequences of potential functional failures. Information in performance standards shall 
regardless of other criticality analyses (e.g. according
 to NORSOK Z
-008) be used as basis for 
categorizing safety critical equipment.
  An inspection
-, testing
- 
and maintenance programme for safety barriers shall be developed as part 
of project development. The programme should include test/inspection/maintenance methods and 

intervals. These shall be determined based upon regulatory requirements, company requirements, 
performance requirements, results/assumptions from analyses (e.g. SIL), criticality analysis (ref 
NORSOK
 Z-
008), manufacturers™ recommendations, operating experience and relevant plant 
maintenance strategy. For instrumented safety systems, also see Norwegian Oil and Gas Association 

GL070. For structures, see 
NORSOK
 N-
005.
  The safety functions/systems should, where reasonably practicable, allow for th
e required testing 
to be carried out without interrupting production or operations.
  Systems shall be established for monitoring barrier integrity, including possible deficiencies and 
degradation. The system should be established and populated with data dur
ing commissioning.
 5.5 Commissioning and start
-up Safety management during installation, start
-up and the operating phases shall be defined in specific 
commissioning and operating procedures. This includes activity requirements and descriptions 
addressing: 
 installation 
and commissioning manuals
; 
 start
-up procedures
. 
Verifying that relevant barrier elements meet all the specified performance requirements is the main 
objective in the commissioning phase. The commissioning test shall be performed under as realisti
c operating conditions as possible. Some tests, e.g. depressurisation systems or hydraulic power for ESD 

systems may have to be put through final capacity testing shortly
 after operations have started.
 The fire water system shall be subject to full scale d
imensioning fire water demand scenario test, i.e. 
simultaneous release of all deluge skids covering the largest and largest neighbouring fire area.
 Relevant experience from commissioning and start
-up shall be transferred to the operational phase.
 Safety related systems/functions required for safe project execution shall be operational to reflect the 
risk when the facility is gradually moved from construction to full operational status. Systems required 
for life support, communication, evacuation, fire detection, active and passive fire protection shall be 
operational when t
he facility is to be inhabited.

 5.6 Accidental loads and resistance
  General
 The accidental loads/actions that can affect facilities or parts of facilities shall be determined. Also, the 
design
 loads that shall form basis for design and operation of facilities, systems and equipment need to be 
determined. Determination of design loads shall ensure that both deterministic and functional 
requirements in applicable regulations are met. The chosen design accidental loads that are to be used as 
basis for design shall ensure that facilities, systems and equipment are designed in such a way that 
relevant accidental situations will not result in unacceptable consequences.
 In addition to loads described i
n the subsequent sections, the following loads shall be included (ref. 
NORSOK N
-003 Actions and action effects and NORSOK Z
-013 Risk and emergency preparedness 
analysis);
  swinging
/falling loads (e.g. impact loads to be absorbed without critical damage including subsea 
pipeline, risers and equipment
), 
 ship 
collisions (e.g. impact loads to be absorbed without critical damage including effects on wells 
and risers
), and
  extreme 
environmental loads.
  Gas explosions 
 Explosion loads from ignited gas clouds are str
ongl
y dependent on factors such as:
  cloud 
size and gas concentration
; 
 gas 
type
; 
 confinement 
and/or congestion of the affected area
; 
 explosion 
relief 
solutions
; 
 ignition 
location
. 
Design explosion loads shall be established using a recognised method (e.g. N
ORSOK Z
-013) and a 
representative geometric explosion model with representative equipment density.
 It is recognized that in the initial design the detail arrangement may not have been developed. An 

explosion study should be performed at an early stage, enabling the key installation parts to be located 
favorably with regard to explosion. The methods and detailing of the input will reflect this situation. 
Explosion loads shall be defined for relevant horizontal and vertical area dividers (pressure and impulse
 from explosion) and relevant equipment (pressure/drag forces).
 Explosion loads shall also be defined for 
areas external to the initial explosion location (typical LQ, utility modules etc.) if applicable.
 Equipment that can become a flying object and can s
ignificantly impair critical safety 
equipment/structures such as fire divisions, riser valves, wellheads, blowdown piping, should be 
considered secured. Examples of such equipment are well hatches, panels, temporary equipment, etc.
  Hydrocarbon fires
 5.6.3.1
 Genera
l 
The heat load from hydrocarbon fires is strongly dependent on:
  hydrocarbon composition and fire type (gas, liquid, jet, liquid spray or pool fire)
; 
 fire size (optical thickness, velocity, turbulence and heat loss)
;

  geometry and ventilation conditions (tu
rbulence, fuel/ventilation controlled, preheating of air, heat 
loss).
 5.6.3.2
 Main load bearing structures
 For main load bearing structures, the heat load distribution is of great importance. A validated 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model shall be used to pr
ovide realistic modelling of the fire source 
and the effect of the surroundings in order to define the design accidental load. Care shall be taken when 

selecting simulation cases. Either these shall be selected and used conservatively, or a larger number o
f 
simulations are necessary to be statistically representative.
 5.6.3.3
 Worst credible process fire
 The worst credible process fire (WCPF) in a fire area is derived from an ignited leak in the ESD
-segment 
including
 possible escalation that will give the worst expo
sure of main load bearing structures and fire
 divisions with regard to duration (not related to the time needed for safe evacuation) and heat load 
distribution. ESD valves and emergency depressurization valves limiting the supply of fuel can be 
assumed to 
function. With respect to liquid spills, the open drain or grating in the 
area can be taken into 
account.
 The load from the WCPF shall be covered by the design accidental load for main load bearing structures 

and fire divisions. The identified WCPF shall n
ot escalate to hydrocarbon pipeline risers or to wells (flow 
from reservoir) to avoid impairment of th
e main load bearing structures.
 Typical relevant scenarios would be:
 1)
 a 
fire from the liquid segment giving the longest duration above critical rate relate
d to main load 
bearing structures and fire divisions
; 
2)
 a 
jet fire from the largest gas EDP segment escalating to item 1 above.
 Relevant segments to be considered for WCPF are topside process segments limited by ESD valves. For 

wellhead areas, gas lift volumes in well annuli shall be included in the evaluation to determine the WCPF, 
unless the supply to the annulus is protected with 
a 
hydraulically activated integrated wellhead valve, i.e. 
with an ESD function, and there are no other leak points on the annulus that can give new critical leak 

rates, ref. also subclause
 26.4
. 
When assessing the WCPF, consequences of possible escalation to one other ESD segment (including the 

largest gas lift annulus volume unless prot
ected as described above), shall be taken into account. 
Normally such escalation will not occur at the end of the fire under consideration and prolong this in a 

way affecting the worst exposure of the main load bearing structures and fire divisions.
 In mos
t cases 
escalations will result in a large increase in the fire size in a certain time period, but normally not in a way 
that will affect the duration of the ini
tial fire in a critical manner.
 5.6.3.4
 Unacceptable ruptures of process equipment in a fire situation.
 Rupture of process equipment in fire situations is unacceptable if this leads to one of the following: 
  a 
fire duration and heat load distribution that is not covered by the design accidental load to 
protect structures and fire divisions. Ref. worst credible process fire
; 
 BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion) 
Œ normally only relevant for volatile liquids 
such as propane
; 
 fatalities 
or serious injury in fire areas outside of the area of the initial event (fire) before escape to 
safe areas has bee
n carried out

. 
In 
addition, 
ruptures that may lead to major economic losses may be defined as unacceptable. Each 
installation needs to define
 unacceptable ruptures based on these principles. In 
addition, 
the ALARP
-principle is important and the best solution would be to avoid the risk of ruptures due to fires by all other 
means than passive fire protection due to e.g. reduced corrosion under in
sulation and inspection.
 The actual criteria will normally be expressed as:
  minimum 
time to rupture causing a certain release rate
; 
o dependent on estimated time to escape from actual fire area and if an escalation has the 
possibility to hinder escape from o
ther fire areas
; 
 max 
allowed pressure at time of rupture
 for piping and vessels (normally different)
; 
o important 
for pressure shock effects, missile effects from vessels and recoil effects from 
pipes
; 
o dependent 
on layout, size of area and possibility for im
pairment of muster areas and 
hindering of evacuation
; 
 max 
allowed release rate
, important 
for
; 
o impairment 
of escape routes
; 
o exposure of neighbouring areas and hence fire spread
; 
o impairment 
of muster areas and evacuation means
; 
 will 
normally be different at
 different times after start of fire
; 
 dependent 
on; 
o layout, size of area and possibility for impairment of muster areas and hindering of 
evacuation
; 
o released 
mass (duration) and fire protection of the surroundings.
 Typical minimum values for the above crit
eria are suggested below. These values shall be carefully 
considered for the actual use (i.e. for the specific installation), and modified as needed based on the given 

principles. If any emergency action can lead to the presence of personnel close to the f
ire, this shall be 
taken into account. Safe escape of personnel that will have to pass the fire, e.g. personnel in the far end or 

personnel
 involved in well securing (closure of well valves and/or BOP) during well interventions shall 
be accommodated for.
 Typical minimum values;
  Vessels
 o Not allowed to rupture before 10 minutes after start of the initial fire.
 o Not allowed to rupture before internal pressure is below 4.5
 barg.
  Pipes
 o Instantaneous release shall not prevent all escape possibilities for personnel
 anywhere on 
the installation to reach Muster Areas
. 
o Hydrocarbon release rate from any one escalation caused by a small jet fire (250
 kW/m
2) 
shall not exceed 2
 kg/s until personnel have escaped the area of the fire. Typical time for 
escape from an area of the fire is 2 minutes. For areas difficult to get out of, this time shall be 

prolonged. 
o Hydrocarbon release rate from any one escalation caused by fires larger than 2
 kg/s, shall 
not exceed the initial fire size until personnel have escaped the area of the
 fire.
 o In early screening work, larger fires can be represented with 350
 kW/m
2 and should not 
escalate with more than 5
 kg/s.
 o For the first two minutes after escape from the area of the fire, gas release rate from any 

escalation shall not exceed 10 kg/s to
 accommodate safe escape from all other areas (this 
rate will normally not impair all escape routes from other areas).

 o Hydrocarbon release rate from any escalation shall not exceed 100 kg/s (typical value to 
avoid excessive heat 
radiation
 and smoke impairm
ent) until all personnel have reached the 
Muster Areas.
 It is recommended to standardise on tubing that has a design pressure of approximately twice the plant™s 
highest normal operating pressure to allow escape from the fire
-affected area prior to rupture 
of tubing 
exposed to fire.

  a The heat flux will vary during the fire duration, and the values in this table are used as the average incident heat fl
ux 
 b The global average heat load of 100 kW/m
2 is to be used for fire exposed area only as long as the leakage rate and
 burning rate is 
above 2 kg/s (
for jet fires, same duration as 350 kW/m
2 peak load). To use this load for the whole segment is generally c
onsidered 
conservative. Smaller areas receiving this load may be used provided it can be properly documented. This can be done by compa
ring 
realistic flame sizes with the extension of the segment under consideration, or for instance by using realistic fire
 simulations. See 
Figure 2.
  In addition to heat load level, the exposure duration is very important for the consequences from fires. 
The duration is dependent on ESD segment size and content, time to 
shutdown
, time to start 
depressurisation, depressurisa
tion rate and leak rate.
 When calculating if and when process segments will rupture due to jet fire exposure due to material 

weakening, the heat exposure from a leak should be evaluated by assessing two representative points in 
the fire as follows:
  Point 1
: Using the maximum duration of a leak rate from any ESD segment in the area above 2
 kg/s 
as the duration with local peak heat load of 350
 kW/m
2 (representing a point at some distances 
from the leak)
. 
 Point 2: Using the maximum 
duration of a leak rate above 0,

contractors and installations, e.g. subsea installation, storage units and fixed platforms.
 6 Layout
 6.1 Role
 The layout and arrangement
 of an installation shall reduce probability and the consequences of accidents 
through location, separation and orientation of areas, equipment and functions. The layout can amongst 
other contribute to:
  minimize the pos
sibility of hazardous accumulations and spread of both flammable liquids and 

gaseous hydrocarbons
; 
 minimize the probability of ignition
; 
 separate areas required to be non
-hazardous from those designated as being hazardous
; 
 minimize the consequences of fire
 and explosions and thereby reduced escalation risk
; 
 facilitate effective emergency response
; 
 provide for adequate arrangements for escape and evacuation.
 6.2 Interfaces
 Layout and arrangement including explosion barriers will interact with design and performa
nce of other 
safety systems and barriers.
 6.3 Required utilities
 Layout is not dependent on any specific utility.

 6.4 Functional requirements
  Main design principles
 The installation(s) shall be oriented with respect to the dominant wind direction to minimize the 
likelihood of a gas release or smoke drifting towards the accommodation and primary evacuation means.
 The installation shall be divided into main areas (accommodation, utility, drilling, wellhead, process and 

hydrocarbon storage). The main areas shall be located and designed to minimize the risk to people, 
environment and assets. Main areas shall normally be separated by use of physical barriers as fire and 
blast divisions to prevent the escalation of an accident from one main area to another. The utility ar
ea should serve as a barrier between hazardous areas and LQ.
 For installations that are part of a complex, the impact from major accidents e.g. blowouts and riser fires 
on the neighbouring installations shall be assessed. Mitigating measures can be length 
of the bridge, 
radiation shielding, etc.
 Muster areas, accommodation, evacuation means and escape routes shall be located where they are least 

affected by fires and explosions.
 Safety systems shall be located or protected to ensure operation during relevan
t emergency conditions. 
Systems and equipment such as FW pump units, emergency generator(s) and switchboards, UPS, ESD/
 F&G nodes, ballast and position keeping controls shall be located as safe as possible in the 

accommodation or utility area. The PSD node
 should be located in the same room as the ESD/F&G nodes, 
reference is made to subclause 
10.5
. 
CCR shall be located as safe as possible in the accommodation or utility area with easy and safe access to 
evacuatio
n facilities.
 Equipment and piping containing hydrocarbons shall be located or protected to minimize consequences 

from dropped objects, crane bo
om fall and swinging loads etc.
 Ventilation inlets, including combustion air inlets, shall be located in a safe area with respect to accidental 

gas leakages, ref. subclause 
17.4.6
. 
Doors from non
-hazardous rooms facing directly towards hazardous areas should be avoided. Doors 
bordering naturally ventilated areas shall be 
self-
closing and conform to fire partition requirements. Non
-hazardous rooms with doors or openings less than 3 m away from hazardous area should be avoided.
 Equipment enclosures, e.g. for noise suppression, shall be subject to special consideration with r
espect to 
required safety functions. Such consideration should include impacts to F&G detection, fire water, drain, 
ventilation (effect on explosion overpressure and source of ventilation 
- 
see 
17.4.
6), area cla
ssification, Ex 
category on components, access, entering of confined space, light fixtures etc. The equipment enclosures 

should be made as small as possible in order to avoid it becoming 
a separate detection/fire area.
  Riser flow line area
 Hydrocarbon rise
rs and associated equipment shall be designed and located to minimise risk due to 
accidental events (such as gas leakages, fires, explosions, ship impact and dropped objects), including 
accidents where riser or associated e
quipment is the initial source.
 Pig launchers and receivers shall be located in open naturally ventilated areas at the periphery of the 
platform facing sea, and with hatches directed away from equipment and structures. It shall not be 
possible to open pressurized pig launchers/receivers.

 Risers and riser ESD valves shall be located or protected to minimize the likelihood of damage below the 
ESD valves causing release of pipeline/riser inventories.
 The riser shall be protected against design 
accidental loads.
 Reference is also made to subcl
ause 
8.4.4
 for other riser requirements.
 The riser ESD valves shall be located as close to sea
-level as practicable, i.e
. 
cellar deck or lower. Riser 
ESD valves should be located in open, naturally ventilated area and such that liquid accumulation below 
the valve is avoided.
  Process area
 Fire and explosion assessments shall be performed along with the development of the layout to minimise 

the 
built
-in escalation potential. This shall be ensured through the follow
ing principles:
  Equipment 
and piping containing high
-pressure gas should be located in the upper decks above the 
module support frame or main hull
. 
 Liquid 
vessels should be located lower than gas equipment
. 
 Low-pressure equipment containing large amount of
 liquids should be located and arranged so that 
exposure to jet fires is minimised.
 Process vessels, process piping, pig launchers and receivers and other hydrocarbon containing equipment 
shall be protected from external impact (e.g. from dropped objects o
r missiles due to disintegration of 
rotating machinery) or as found required through analysis.
  Well areas
 Drilling risers and conductors shall be designed and positioned or protected to minimize the likelihood of 
damage, including that due to ship impact a
nd dropped objects.
 For installations with main support frame (MSF), the wellheads should be located above the MSF in order 

to reduce exposure of the MSF from a wellhead fire.
  Piping
 Routing of piping containing hydrocarbon to or through the utility area s
hall be avoided except for fuel 
lines to utility systems. Hydrocarbon piping shall not be routed within the LQ areas.
 Hydrocarbon transfer lines to/from bridges should be routed as safe as possible, preferably along the
 periphery of the installation.
 Routi
ng of piping containing any liquid or hydrocarbon gas is not allowed through electrical room, 
instrument room and control room. However, atmospheric systems (e.g. non
-hazardous drains) may be 
routed through such rooms provided corrosion resistant materials
 are used and there are no leakage 
points, flanges etc within the room.
 To avoid area classification of production laboratory, pressure control valves for flammable gases shall be 
located in open air outside laboratory.
 Routing of hydrocarbon piping within
 areas where emergency equipment is located shall be limited to 
diesel fuel supply lines for emergency equipment themselves.
 Pipework containing flammable liquid should not be routed such that a leak can come into contact with 

hot surfaces with temperature
 exceeding auto
-ignition temperature, e.g. above combustion engines and 
exhaust piping.

 On FPSO crude lines to aft offloading systems are accepted provided they are located a
t the side of the 
installation.
  Lifting and lay down
 Crane coverage and lay down areas shall be arranged to promote safe crane operations with free visibility 

from crane cabin and minimise the risk of dropped objects. Considerations shall be given to sidewise 
movement of load.
 Within defined lifting zones equipment, or piping, containing hydrocarbons, flammable or toxic gas/liquid 

shall be protected from dropped objects.
 Lifting above high voltage equipment and cables shall be assessed, and protection shall be considered 

installed. 
The lifting zones shall be defined and shown on the lift
ing map in crane cabin. Crane software should give 
alarm in crane when lifting restriction boundaries are exceeded. Allowable weight chart for laydown 
areas shall be established.
 Laydown and storage area should not be located in hazardous area. Location of
 laydown areas and 
temporary storage of equipment shall be considered to minimize effect on explosion overpressure, 

ventilation, flying debris from explosions and possible negative effects on technical barriers (e.g. F&G 
detection, FW system, natural venti
lation).
 Reference is made to NORSOK R
-002 for further details.
  Storage and handling of explosives
 Explosives shall be stored and handled such that the risk of fire, explosion and falling/flying objects is as 
low as possible, e.g.:
  Area of storage shall ha
ve a low probability of impact from falling loads and heat radiation from 
possible fires threatening the storage area. Fire water shall be available for cooling of perforating 

guns in the event of fire in the area. See subclause 
21.4.10.2
21.4.7
 for requirements for fire water. 
  The storage area shall be clearly marked and with restricted access.
  Quantities of stored explosive substances shall at any time be kept to a m
inimum. The duration of 
explosive substances storage at site shall be adapted to the planned period of use.
  Provisions should be in place to safely handle explosives that can constitute a risk in the event of a 

hazard and accident situation:
 o provisions 
for
 safe removal or relocation of explosives by cranes in the event of a fire in 
areas near the explosives should be available
; 
o loaded 
perforating guns should be stored with end caps permitting pressure relief (venting) 
in the event of exposure to a fire.
  Exp
losives shall be secured so that they do not inadvertently explode during storage and use, e.g., 
electrically triggered perforation equipment shall be shielded against radio waves and other 

electrical fields. Detonators or initiators that require the enfor
cement of radio silence shall not be 
used.
  Floating installations
 For floating 
installations,
 the following shall apply:
  Systems with hydrocarbons with flashpoint below 60
 °C shall not be installed in columns or 
pontoons for floating installations. 
Storage
 of diesel in atmospheric tanks is acceptable
.

 NORSOK 
© 2018
  Vital control functions (e.g. maritime control/bridge, process control and special emergency 
preparedness functions) shall be arranged in one common control centre for the entire installation
. 
 Process area sha
ll be separated from FPSO hydrocarbon storage tank top by air gap of minimum 3 
m and plated deck and bunding in order to avoid hydrocarbons spreading to the storage tank deck
. 
 Reference is made to 
21.4.4
 with respect to fire 
protection
 of tank deck
. 
 Equipment that can represent an ignition source (e.g. exhaust ducts and generators) 
should be 
located upwind of potential leak sources on floating installation that will be turned up against the 
wind
. 
 The effects of 'green sea' shall
 be carefully evaluated and means of protection arranged
. 
 Submerged crude pumps shall be used for FPSOs. If submerged pumps are not selected for FSUs, 
the decision shall be supported by a safety study
. 
 Crude oil transfer lines or any other hydrocarbon line
 shall not be located in double bottom.
  Turret
 The turret arrangement design shall aim at achieving open naturally ventilated areas and minimising 
explosion pressure. Enclosed mechanically ventilated areas should be restricted to LER/LIR with control 
or sp
ecial equipment that requires special protection or cannot be located in outdoor environment. Such 
enclosed premises shall have overpressure ventilation, with air taken from and exhausted to a non
-hazardous area. Location of the premises themselves as well
 as their ventilation inlets shall take into 
account the prevailing wind directions.
 Where anchor winches are arranged on the deck below riser termination and ESD valves, the deck 

separating the areas shall be solid and gas tight.
 Turret areas and piping s
hall be designed to minimise the risk of jet fires towards tank tops.
  Explosion design principles
 The amount of explosion relief available, the degree of blockage and congestion in an area of an explosion 
shall be optimised to reduce explosion risk. Design
 principles in ISO 13702, A.3, B.1, B.10 to B.11, should 
be followed.
 The use of explosion panels and weather protection shields shall be kept to a minimum. Natural 
ventilation and open modules shall be preferred. Where such arrangements are likely to cause an 
unacceptable working environment, special solutions such as temporary shields for maintenance 
operations should be considered.
 The arrangement of equipment in an area, and particularly near ventilation openings, can have a major 

influence on the peak overpressures expected in an area. Cable trays, junction boxes, piping and 

equipment shall be located so that they will not significantly increase turbulence, block explosion 
ventilation openings and reduce the free vent area, and thus increase explosion l
oads.
  Hot air exposure of helicopter deck
 Offshore installations will contain a variety of systems and processes that can emit gases and hot air 

plumes, typically generated by turbine generators, diesel engines, flares, and emergency depressurisation 
syste
ms. Hot air flow from these systems may create turbulence and other thermal effects that may 
severely affect helicopter operations, unless adequate risk reducing measures are taken at the design 

stage. The design shall be in accordance with clause 5, NORSOK C
-004 Helicopter Deck on Offshore 
Installations.

 6.5 Survivability requirements
 Equipment with a safety function, during and after the accident, shall generally be located and protected 
such that its role and function are maintain
ed. 
7 Structural integrity
 7.1 Rol
e 
The structural integrity shall withstand all design load conditions (action) under normal operation and 

also ensure that the relevant safe
ty functions are maintained after impact from design accidental loads .
 7.2 Interfaces
 Structural integrity has interfac
es with the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout (Clause 
6); 
 Containment (Clause 
8); 
 Passive fire protection (Clause 
20
); 
 Active Fire Protection (Clause 
21
); 
 Escape and evacuation (Clause 
22
); 
 Marine systems and position keeping (Clause 
24
); 
 Avoidance of Vessel Collisions
 (Clause 
25
).
 7.3 Required utilities
 Structural integrity is normally not dependent on any specific utility. Water filled structures may be 

depende
nt on supply of sea/fire wate
r. 
7.4 Functional requirements
 Load bearing structures shall be designed with sufficient robustness in accordance with 
 NORSOK N
-001.
 7.5 Survivability requirements
 The design shall ensure sufficient structural integrity to withstand design accidental loads. This 
applies to 

the main structure as well as other critical structures such as derricks and flare towers which may lead to 
severe worsening of the accident scenario in case of collapse. The capacity of main load bearing 
structures shall as a minimum be maintai
ned until the facility has been evacuated and be designed in 
accordance with requirements in NORSOK Z
-013, 
NORSOK 
N-
003 and 
NORSOK 
N-
001. The design 
accidental fire load for the structure shall as a minimum include the worst credible process fire, ref. 

5.6.3.3
. 
In 
addition, 
environmental consequences (e.g. from well blowout) and consequences for neighbouring 
installations shall be considered (e.g. bridge connections, jack
-up / jacket, etc.).

 8 Containment
 8.1 Role
 The 
containment function shall prevent release of hydrocarbons, other flammable fluids and/or harmful 
fluids (chemicals, toxic gases, steam, etc.).
 8.2 Interfaces
 The containment function has interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout (Claus
e 6); 
 Process safety system (Clause 
10
); 
 Passive fire protection (Clause 
20
); 
 Active Fire Protection (Clause 
21
). 
8.3 Required utilities
 The containment function is not dependent on any specific utility.
 8.4 Functional requirements
  General
 All risers, piping, valves, connections, pumps, rotating machinery, instruments and other components in 
the systems 
handling hydrocarbons, other flammable fluids and/or harmful fluids (chemicals, toxic gases, 
etc.) shall be designed, constructed, maintained and operated with the aim to avoid leaks to occur.
 All components and systems shall be designed to enable necessary inspection, testing and correction in 
compliance with established insp
ection and maintenance program.
  Piping 
 The use of flexible hoses connected to processing systems shall be minimized, 
e.g. there should be a fixed 

system for annulus de
-pressurization 
of gas lift wells.
 The use of flexible hose connections for well stream transfer within the turret and between turret and 

ship, should be minimised.
  Flanges and connections 
 The number of mechanical connections (flanges and hubs) in systems with hydrocarbo
n inventory shall 
be kept to a minimum, i.e. by use of welded connections where feasible. Mechanical connections in a 
hydrocarbon 
piping system shall as a minimum conform to
 NORSOK L
-001.
 NOTE
 It should be noted that flanges of a compact type, according to NORS
OK L
-005, have a significantly 
lower leak frequency as compared to traditional ASME flanges. Hence, a reduced risk level can be 
obtained by selecting compact type flanges.
 Relief/emergency depressurisation headers should be designed without flanges. Flange
s for future tie
-ins 
is acceptable.
 These shall be of a compact type. Passive fire protection shall be applied in accordance with 
subclause
 20.4.3
.

 There should be no flanges in hydrocarbon piping to, or through, the utility ar
ea to avoid hazardous 
classification and resulting requirements for additional safety systems and barriers. One flanged 
connection may be installed on the fuel line to each combustion engine, turbine and fired unit in the 
utility area as well as transfer l
ines in offloading systems in utility areas for connecting the equipment 
without affecting the area classification.
 With respect to instrument connections (connected to a piping valve) to hydrocarbon vessels, piping or 
equipment, the bore/orifice through the vessel
-/piping wall (through nozzle) should be as small as 
possible to minimise the leak rate in the event of instrument connection leaks. Consideration shall be 

made to possible hydrate formation, wax deposit or pl
ugging due to other deposits.
 A flangi
ng philosophy should be established by relevant disciplines, taking into account the installation 
and operational risk of type of connections and welded solutions. 
Generally, 
the number of flanges should 
be minimized.
  Risers
 The following applies above sea
 level for the riser side of the ESD valve for pipelines containing 
flammable fluids:
  Flanges on the pipeline side of the riser ESD valves shall not be used for fixed steel type risers. The 

benefit of installing an SSIV shall be evaluated.
  For flexible ris
ers an SSIV shall be installed at the riser base. An SSIV can also be a non
-return valve 
provided function/reliability requirements are established and that it is tested.
  The SSIV can be omitted provided that the consequence of a release is sufficiently small, i.e. does 
not prevent escape and evacuation due to escalation to other risers and result in loss of structural 
integrity.
 Parameters affecting the evaluation are type of concept, semi
-type or ship
-shape floating 
installation, passive fire protection 
on structure and risers, stabilized liquid or short distance to 

isolation valves on subsea template or other platform.
 Two mechanical connections above water is accepted on the riser side of ESD valve connecting the 

flexible riser to the rigid section tops
ide to simplify installation and replacement of the flexible riser. The 
flanges should be of compact type, see NORSOK L
-005. Mechanical connections shall be leak tested via a 
test port to verify leak tight assembly before the riser is filled with fluid for
 pressure and leak testing. The 
bolts and flanges shall have passive fire protection.
 With respect to flexible risers particular attention shall be made to the design, operation, condition 
monitoring and inspection to ensure pressure containment integrity 
during the whole lifetime of the 
risers. 
For both flexible risers and steel type risers, a tie
-in connection is acceptable subsea if;
  the 
flexible pipe attached to the connector shall be specified in accordance with API
 Spec 
17J, while 
the rigid pipe attac
hed to the connector shall be specified in accordance with DNVGL
-ST-F201
; 
 the location of the connector is optimised (distance, water depth) such that possible risk impacts 
are reduced as far as practicable
; 
 design 
and performance verification of subsea flanges and hubs shall be according to ISO 10423
; 
 for a flanged connection, compact flanges according to NORSOK L
-005 shall be used for flexible 
risers. 
Instrument connections 
or any other connections on the pipeline side of the riser ESD valve are not 
permi
tted, except if overpressure protection of the riser/pipeline/flowline is required due to high well 
shut
-in pressure (design to full pressure is not practical). In such cases two instrumented safety function 
shall be implemented ref. subclauses 
10.4.1
 and 
10.4.7
. A PSV shall also be installed to cater for HIPPS

 leaks.
 If the PSV is required to meet the overpressure criteria in accordance with SIL allocation for the 
involved safety fun
ction, the relief and flare capacity shall be adjusted accordingly.
 With reference to
 Figure 3
 the PSV arrangement shall comply with the following:
  An ESD valve upstream Riser PSV to be installed and located as 
close as possible
 to the offtake from 
the riser.
  The ESD valve shall be welded, i.e not flanged.
  The ESD valve 
shall
 receive automatic shutdown signal on confirmed fire detection in the riser area 
and location of Riser PSV as well as on APS. The ESD valve 
should not receive any other automatic 
shutdown signals (from e.g. PSD, PCS, ESD,
 –).  The ESD valve should be
 fail in position and have fire/heat protection of valve, actuator and signal 
cable similar to the Riser ESD valve. The fire / heat protection shou
ld in addition to the riser valve 
fire integrity requirement, also ensure valve closure upon demand when exposed to jet fire 
 (for ~4
-5 minutes).
  Local reset function of the ESD valve as required for other ESD valves should not be implemented to 

ensure possibility of remote operation of the ESD valve from CCR.
  It should be ensured that the riser is not the weakest point of the pipeline/riser system.
   Figure 3
 Š PSV arrangement to handle HIPPS leaks
 8.5 Survivability requirements
 Equipment and piping within the containment function, including instrument tubing (see subclause 
5.6.3.4
), shall resist the design accidental loads they can be exposed to. With respect to explosion loads 
the design accidental load should be applied to the equipment 
and piping within the containment 
function.
 To decide which hydrocarbon segments that shall withstand design fire load, see subclause 
5.6.3.3
 and 
5.6.3.4

9.3 Required utilities
 Open drain safety function is not dependent on any specific utility.
 9.4 Functional requirements
 The requirements for open drain systems are valid for the whole installation (wellhead, drilling, process 
and utility areas).
  Minimize fire/escalation risk arisin
g from spills and leaks
 Measures shall be provided for dealing with spills and leaks in all areas that have a source of flammable 

or hazardous liquid so as to minimize the risk of fires and personnel exposure to hazardous materials. 
The drainage systems sh
all be designed in accordance with NORSOK P
-002 and ISO 13702.
 The capacity of the drainage system, i.e. including overflow lines for fire water, shall be able to handle full 

fire water capacity and the liquid leak rate associated with the worst credible p
rocess fire, typically 5
 kg/s 
within the bunded area. The drain header capacity shall be sufficient to avoid backpressures that cause 

liquid to flow back into other open parts of the system during deluge/firefighting. Simultaneous 
deluge/firefighting in re
levant number of areas shall be considered, ac
cording to the safety strategy.
 All tanks and vessels containing flammable liquids shall have a deck bunding covering the tank perimeter 

controlling spreading of spills, and there shall 
be drainage within the b
unding.
 Design of the drain system to handle fire water on a floater is challenging due to vessel motions which 

may result in liquid flowing directly to sea. Particular attention should be made to prevent spreading of 
fire water and drainage between fire areas, decks and lower escape ways.
 Tanks collecting drains from hazardous areas shall be purged with inert gas
 to prevent explosive 
mixtures.
  Separation of drain systems
 Closed and open drainage facilities shall be arranged so that they cannot affect each 
other adversely.
 Hazardous and non
-hazardous open drains shall be physically separated to prevent backflow of 
hydrocarbons from hazardous to a non
-hazardous area. However, they can be processed in the same o
ily 
water treatment system.
 If liquid from the hazardous and non
-hazardous open drains are pumped to the same caisson or sump, 
the possibility of backflow into the non
-hazardous
 open drain shall be prevented.
 Measures shall be implemented to prevent that vapors from the oily water treatment system enter 
the 
drainage systems, i.e. liquid seals shall be provided where the headers from open drain enter the 
collection tank(s), and these shall be designed for maximum possible back pressure.

 Collection tanks shall be vented to an atmospheric vent system, and the outlet shall terminate at a safe 
location, i.e. away from personnel, equipment air i
ntakes and sources of ignition.
 Fire water and liquid spills on the helideck shall be drained in a safe, controlled and effective manner 
through a 
dedicated pipe drainage
 system.
 The open drain system shall provide effective means, e.g. liquid/fire seals, to prevent flammable liquid 

vapors and gases to spread to other fire areas via the drain system. Vent lines from seals shall be routed 
back to the area where the drains originate, or to a safe location.
 There shall be no connection between the drilling and production open drain systems. Drilling drain 

systems will require special solutions to handle solids and particles from drilling areas. Ref
erence is made 
to NORSOK P
-00
2.
 Temporary storage of flammable liquids in tote tanks shall only be located in areas with an adequate 
collection and drain system.
 9.5 Survivability requirements
 The drain system, such as drain box and piping, shall not impair the integrity of fire divisions
, see 
subclause 
20.4.1

 Process safety system
 10.1 Role
 Process safety means of protection, including mechanical protection devices and safety instrumented 

functions, shall ensure that the process conditions do not exceed specified 
process safety limits.
 The aim is to control any abnormal process operating conditions to prevent and/or minimize possible 

accidental releases. Typical actions, by means of protection such as Process 
Shutdown
 (PSD) functions 
and Pressure Safety Valves (PSV
), include:
  Stop hydrocarbon flow
  Shutdown
 process and utility equipment
  Pressure relief
  Isolate leaks
  Shutdown
 heat input to
 the process
 The extent of a PSD situation will depend on type of abnormality, and may vary from equipment 

shutdown with minimum ef
fect on the production rate, to a total process shutdown.
 10.2 Interfaces
 The process safety system has interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout 
(Clause 
6); 
 Containment 
(Clause 
8); 
 Emergency 
Shutdown
 (Clause 10)
; 
 Emergency Depressurisation a
nd Flare
/Vent System (Clause 
12
); 
 Human 
Œ machine interface (HMI) for CCR systems (Clause 
16
); 
 Marine S
ystems and Position Keeping (Clause 
24
).

 10.3 Required utilities
 The performance of the process safety system is dependent on:
  uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS) to 
keep the PSD system operational upon 
loss of main 
electrical power
; 
 hydraulic 
supply including back
-up hydraulic accumulators for closure of double acting valves
; 
 instrument air supply (local accumulators, if necessary).
 10.4 Functional requirements
  Process safety principles 
 The process safety functions shall 
provide a reliable and fast detection of process upsets and execution of 
the actions that are considered necessary to control the 
situation and avoid escalation.
 For topside functions, the PSD system shall be independent f
rom the process control system.
 For subsea systems requiring PSD protection, the PSD function shall be independent of the subsea control 
system, i.e. if any failure of the subsea control system will require PSD protection, e.g overpressure 

protection.
 Process and auxiliary systems shall be
 designed such that no single failure during operations can lead to 
unacceptable hazardous situations. 
The process safety system shall normally provide two levels of 
protection to prevent or minimize the
 consequences of an undesirable event within the process. If 
practicable, the two levels shall be provided by
 functionally different types of device.
 The design shall be 
in accordance with NORSOK P
-002.
 Process safety layers of protection shall be established and designed in accordance with API RP 14C or 
ISO
 10418 including referenced process standards that in a prescriptive manner often make 
recommendations of conventional solutions. Note that ISO 10418 in subclause 6.2.15 states that if an 
instrument
-based system is used for primary protection, it will not 
need to comply with IEC 61511
-1 
provided the secondary protection system is self
-actuating (PSV or rupture disc) and meets the 
requirements of relevant codes and standards. Then, a deterministic approach based upon industry 
accepted typical protective solutions is also acceptable for PSD functions, e.g predefined performance 
requirement (PFD values) as established in Norwegian
 Oil and Gas Association GL070.
 In order to avoid cascading effect, the process shutdown shall be realized in accordance with ISO 104
18, 
6.2.16 / API RP 14C, 4.2.3.
 Where utilities, such as cooling water, are shared by process systems and equipment in non
-hazardous 
areas, the utility system shall be designed to prevent migration of flammable liquids and gases into non
-hazardous areas an
d systems.
 Loss of instrument air or hydraulic supply (PALL) shall initiate a full production shutdown.
  Process 
shutdown
 (PSD) valves 
 Shutdown
 valves on the liquid phase outlet from pressure vessels shall be located as close to the pressure 
vessel as possible, and the number of leak sources between the pressure vessel and 
shutdown
 valve shall 
be minimised. 
Shutdown
 valves shall have a fail
-safe function under flowing conditions, i.e. normally fail
-safe close. If the 
shutdown
 valve has a role 
5.6.3.3
related to fire design loads, it shall be defined as an ESD 
valve, 
refe
re
nce
 is made to subclause 
5.6.3.3

  Pressure safety valves (PSVs)
 PSVs shall be designed, installed and maintained 
acc
ording
 to recognized international standards (API 
STD 520/521).
  Alarms, automatic actions
 Alarms shall support operator decision
-making during upsets and accidental situations. Actions shall be 
initiated automatically when process or equipment protection limits are exceeded.
  Response time
 The maximum response time of a process safety function to reach safe state on demand in actual 
operation shall be defined accordin
g to process dynamic behaviour.
 Typical response times that shall be complied with unless faster responses are required from dynamic 

analysis:
  Time from signal from sensor to start of PSD execution, e.g. de
-energised solenoid valve, should be 
less than 2 seconds.
  PSD valve travel time (in service) should not exceed 2 seconds/inch (valve size) to 
reach safe state. 

For valves 8 inch or less, a typical travel time should be set to 15 seconds.
  New valves should have a design margin to allow for degradation during service life, typically 1 

second/inch.
  Logic solver
 The logic
 solver (firmware, as standa
rd manufacturer provision) shall be in compliance with 
IEC
 61508/IEC 61511 and Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070.
  Instrument based systems for secondary pressure protection
 In the event instrument based systems need to be installed for secondary pressure protection, ref. 

scenarios described in NORSOK P
-002, the solutions shall be designed such that the annual frequency of 
overpressure above the temperature adjusted test pressure shall be less than 1x10
-5
. 
The annual frequency of overpressure above the
 code™s accepted pressure shall be less than 1x10
-3
. 
When applying the above requirements, the following leak frequencies should be applied:
 1)
 for pressure lower than the code™s accepted pressure: p(leakage) = 0 (zero)
; 
2)
 for pressure between the code™s accept
ed pressure and test pressure
 p(leakage) = 1x10
-2
; 
3)
 for pressure above test pressure p(leakage) = 1
. 
The secondary pressure protection system shall be realized independently fro
m both the PSD and ESD 
systems.
 Where a PSV is installed for leak protection of 
secondary instrument protection of riser/
 pipeline/
 flowline, reference is made to 
8.4.4
. 
10.5 Survivability requirements
 The logic solver and essential utilities should be located as safe as possible in the accommod
ation or 
utility area. If located in LER outside of the accommodation or utility area, consideration shall be made to

 the consequences of loss of process feedback signals, e.g. valve position, pressure and temperature, due to 
ignition source isolation of t
he LER. Reference is made to 
6.4.1
. 
In case of RIO cabinets installed in hazardous areas, they should be located as safe as possible.

 Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD)
 11.1 Role
 The purpose of the ESD system is to prevent esc
alation of abnormal conditions into a major hazardous 
event and to limit the extent and duration of any such events that do occur.
 11.2 Interfaces
 ESD system has interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:
  Process safety system (Clause 
10
); 
 Emergency Depressurisation and Flare/Vent System 
(Clause 
12
); 
 Gas detection (Clause 
13
); 
 Fire detection (Clause 
14
); 
 Ignition Source Control ISC (Clause
 15
); 
 Public address (PA), alarm and emergency communication 
(Clause 
18
); 
 Passive fire protection (PFP) (Clause 
20
).
 In addition, ESD initiations will activate, directly or indirectly, safety functions such as HVAC, emergency 
power and lighting, PA, subsea control, offshore cranes, drilling and well intervention and marine 
systems.
 11.3 Requ
ired utilities
 ESD system performance is dependent on:
  uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS) to keep the ESD system operational upon loss of main 
electrical power
; 
 hydraulic 
supply including back
-up hydraulic accumulators for closure of double acting valves
; 
 instrument 
air supply (local accumulators, if necessary
); 
 HVAC to ensure overpressure and 
temperature
 control of LER/LIR
. 
11.4 Functional requirements
  Manual ESD activation 
 Manual activation of the ESD system shall be possible from strategically positioned sta
tions where 
accessibility and manning in a hazard situation is taken into account.
 Possibility for manual activation should be provided at strategic positions such as:
  CCR (APS/ESD1/ESD2)
; 
 helideck (APS)
; 
 muster areas/lifeboat stations (APS)
; 
 bridge connec
tions (ESD2)
;

  drilling areas (driller 
shutdown
 and ESD2)
; 
 exits from process and wellhead areas (ESD2)
; 
 strategic located stations along escape routes (ESD2).
 APS activation possibility to be considered at brid
ge landings in addition to CCR.
 Manual activation buttons shall be protected against inadvertent activation, e.g. with protective covers or 
rotary switch and duplicated buttons for APS. Each activation button shall be clearly marked, and a 
consistent colour coding shall be applied for the activation b
uttons, e.g. black with yellow stripes for APS 
and yellow for ESD2.
 Isolation of emergency power supplies i.e. UPS upon APS shall be executed via a timer independent of the 

logic solver, normally 30 min to ensure that necessary safety critical equipment is
 in operation during 
escape and evacuation. Separate function(s) shall be provided allowing bypassing t
imer based APS 
countdown.
 An independent function, e.g. disconnecting the power to the ESD logic solvers, shall be included allowing 

safe shutdown upon f
ailure of programmable logic. The function may be realized by setting the 
installation in a safe state, i.e. initiating emergency depressurization and shutdown equivalent to an ESD1 

level. 
Special consideration shall be made to disconnection of centralised
 escape lights such that no single fault 
shall result in disc
onnection of all escape lights.
  Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD) final elements
 ESD valves shall isolate and sectionalise the process 
segments in
 a fast and reliable manner to reduce the 
total amount of 
released hydrocarbons in the event of a leak.
 ESD valves shall limit ESD segment volume 
in accordance with subclause 
5.6.3.3
 ESD valves are not necessarily required at the fire divisions between 
fire areas. The valve arrangemen
t shall be able to isolate at design flow conditions including 
consideration of increased flow from possible external leak, e.g. well flowline leak/breakage immediately 
downstream WV or platform side of ESD riser valves.
 The following 
shutdown
 valves shall
 always be categorised as ESD valves:
  valves located in, or are the nearest 
shutdown
 valve to, a hydrocarbon riser
; 
o chemical injection to subsea wells do not require ESD valves topside provided that two 
independent well barrier elements in accordance w
ith 
NORSOK D
-010 are installed;
 o chemical injection subsea at riser base, e.g. MEG and methanol for hydrate prevention 

during shutdown, shall be subject to special considerations and may require topside ESD or 
block valve (normally closed);
  valves located on the liquid outlet of large liquid vessels, such as separators and coalescers, see 

10.4.2
 for location of valves;
  valves located in a utility system where the consequences of valve failure with respect to safety ma
y 
be significant, shall be subject to special consideration;
  well isolation valves (DHSV, MV, WV, ASV, chemical injection, actuated annulus valves on gas lifted 

wells; 
 actuated SSIV (tagged as ESD valve). Reference is made to subclause 
8.4.4
 for evaluations on need 
for.
 For bridge connected installations with flow lines between the installations, considerations shall be made 

with respect to need for ESD valves related to worst credible process fire to stop flow b
etween the 
installations. Location of such valves should be considered with respect to area classification and should 

preferably be installed in hazardous area (process/wellhead area).

 An ESD valve may be used as a PSD valve. The main valve including actua
tor and related accessories such 
as pilot valve (ﬁboost/quick dumpﬂ) and travel speed restrictor will be common, but shall have physically 
separate ESD/PSD activation signals and solenoids. The valves shall be tagged as ESD valves.
 ESD valves shall have ei
ther spring return or local accumulators to ensure fail
-safe function under flowing 
conditions, i.e. normally fail
-safe close. Spring return type of valves shall be used when required size is 
available, normally 24 inches or less, as this is a more reliable fail
-safe function compared to double 
acting valves. Local accumulators shall have 300
 % capacity and should be placed as close as possible to 
the valve.
 ESD valves shall have defined criteria for leakage rates based on a study reflecting valve criticality. There 
shall be facilities for testing of internal leakage rate in the direction(s) the valve
 has a role.
 ESD valves, shall have local reset function. e.g. local reset of solenoid valve (may not be required for 

remote operated platforms). ESD valves shall be equipped with both remote and local position indication. 
It is acceptable that the position indicator signal is routed to PCS for monitoring
 of valve action at a 
shutdown.
 Manual valves in safety control circuits (e.g. hydraulic return and accumulato
r supply or means for valve 
travel time adjustment) shall be secured in correct position, e.g. by use of lock nuts.
  Emergency shutdown (ESD) actions
 The ESD system shall activate all actions in accordance with the Safety Strategy. Consideration shall be 

given to interrelations between interconnected installations, e.g. by pipelines or control systems.
 The ESD functions shall be arranged in a tree
-structured hierarchy, APS, ESD1 and ESD2. General 
principles are shown in 
Figure 4
 and should be used as basis for the facility specific safety strategy. The 
ESD hierarchy should be simple and unambiguous minimizing number of sub
-levels.
 A higher ESD level 
shall initiate lower levels including PSD. A signal on a certain level should neve
r initiate shutdowns or 
actions on higher levels.
 ESD actions shall include depending on ESD level (see 
Figure 4
):
  shutdown of dry well trees, riser valves and subsea well trees when wells are located w
ithin the 
platform safety
 zone.
 NOTE
 with reference to 
Figure 4
, s
hutdown will include closure of DHSV and/or SSIV for specific 
scenarios
; 
 initiate stop of subsea pipeline and flowlines connected to the installation outside of the platform 
safety zone. The closure signal for both subsea wells and other imports can be realized in subsea 
control system, except upon APS and F&G detection in riser area where isolation is performed by 

ESD power cut to subsea facility, ref 
11.4.5
. For 
other imports, the ESD system submits a PSD signal 
(or by fail to safe PCS signal) to the connected sources (riser valves), ref. subclause 
10.4.1
; 
 shutdown and sectioning of the hydrocarbon process facilities
; 
 initiation of EDP
; 
 ignition source isolation
; 
 shutdown of main power generation
; 
 start/stop of emergency power generator via voltage sensor
; 
 shutdown of drilling, intervention and work
-over equipment not required for well control.
 Any shutdown, spurious or 
intended, shall require a manual reset from CCR.
 During well intervention DHSV and master valves shall be disconnected from the platform ESD system. It 

shall be possible to operate the DHSV and master valves in accordance with subclause
 26.5

 Loss of ESD signals between an NNMI and remote control centre shall 
shutdown
 the NNMI upon a time 
delay. The time delay should not exceed 10
 min.
 ESD of the remote control centre shall result in 
shutdown
 of the NNMI.
 When i
nstalled, remotely operated Subsea Isolation Valves (SSIV) shall as a minimum be automatically 
closed upon APS activation and confirmed fire 
or gas detection in riser area.
 The X

 The intention of the LAHH on ESD2 level is to provide a secondary instrumented process protection
   
level. As an alternative to initiation of ESD2, shutdown of relevant ESD valves (using the ESD solenoid
   
valves) and initiation of PSD is acceptable. PSD does not 
initiate
 general alarm, stop of fuel gas and
   
ignit

  Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD) alarm annunciation
 ESD system status shall continuously be available in CCR, and the system shall raise alarms in CCR for 
operator awareness or actions, considering:
  ESD level initiation
; 
 ESD function failure 
to execute actions upon demand
; 
 ESD function (sensor, logic solver or final element) defect or failure.
 Personnel shall be warned to ensure safe escape and evacuation, ref. clause
18
. Prepare to abandon alarm 
(at APS level) shall be initiated manually. Upon any confirmed ESD (auto or manual), general alarm shall 

be automatically initiated.
 Manual initiation of ESD1 or ESD2 level shall as a minimum initiate general 
alarm on affected platform. In addition the F&G system shall initi
ate automatic general alarm as described 

in clause 
13
 (
Table 2
) and clause 
14
 (
Table 3
).
 An ESD alarm shall be alerted in other strategic locations, and announcement shall be made by means of 

and at typical locations such as:

 Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD) response time
 Response time of all equipment and components included in th
e ESD function shall be defined.
 Standardised response times shall be defined for groups of similar ESD functions except
 when individual 
ESD functions require exceptional response time to meet intended functionality.
 Typical response times that should be complied with are:
  Time from activation (ESD node receives signal) to start execution, e.g. de
-energised solenoid valve, 
should normally be less than 2 seconds.
  The total response time for closure of dry well tree (MV&WV
) should not exceed 45 seconds.
  With reference to topside ESD valves™ characteristics, the travel time (during lifetime) should not 
exceed 2 second /inch (va
lve size) to reach safe state. For valves 8ﬂ or less, a typical travel time of 
15 seconds should be used. Reference is also made to subclause 
10.4.5
 regarding maximum travel 
time for PSD valve
.

  New valves should
 have a design margin to allow for degradation during service life, typically 1 
second/inch.
 For subsea facilities extended valve travel times are accepted due to special subsea design conditions:
  
 The total response time for closure of wet well tree (MV&W
V via sequential closure) should not 
exceed 60 seconds.
  The ESD 
shutdown
 should be delayed in order to allow a sequential closure of the well valves via 
subsea control facilities prior to the ESD disconnection of electrical power supply applying power 
cut 
and bleed off via normally energized ﬁQuick dumpﬂ hydraulic valve. The time from ESD 
initiation to all XT barrier valves are in closed position (by sequential closure followed by power 
cut) shall be less than 4 minutes. Such delays shall however not be app
lied for wells located within 
the defined safety zone of the platform or if risk analysis has required well closure time which is 

shorter than achieved by th
e delay and ESD actuation time.
  The total response time for closure of SSIVs should be maximum 2 minutes unless risk analysis has 

require
d a shorter valve closure time.
  Applied time delays associated with an ESD action to achieve safe state shall be clearly identified in 

relevant documentation, e.g. C&E diagrams and SRS.
  Logic solver
 The logic solver (f
irmware, as standard manufacturer provision) shall be in compliance with 
IEC
 61508/IEC 61511 and Norwegian
 Oil and Gas Association GL070.
  Emergency shutdown (ESD) independence
 The ESD system shall operate as an independent system.
 Prerequisites to fulfil t
he independence 
requirements are:
  ESD safety related functions shall be realised in addition to and independent of the PSD and PCS 

functions, but the ESD system units (logic solver) can be an integral node of the overall SAS.
  ESD system units (logic solver
) shall only be used for ESD related safety functions.
  ESD sensor loop including accessories (e.g. process tapping, impulse lines, air supply branch
-off and 
power fuses) shall be separate from other functions, directly connected to ESD system unit.
  ESD fin
al element shall be operated directly from ESD system unit, but such devices may in addition 
be operated by other safety related systems if they have separate activation devices
 e.g., ESD valves 
used for PSD.
  An appropriate level of independency shall be obtained for ESD functions (final element) if they are 

integrated within remote/local panels, e.g.:
 o ESD functions operate independent of well control and PSD in well control panel
; o ESD of electrical equipment
; 
o ESD of 
turbines
, compressors etc.
 The ESD can be realised in a common HMI and network arrangement (i.e. of the SAS) provided that any 
failures in any systems connected within the same arrangement do not adversely affect the intended ESD 
safety functions. This realisation shall be subject to given prere
quisites as described in Norwegian Oil and 

Gas Association GL070.
 Status feedback and deviation reporting/alarm (e.g. ESD limit switches, valve closure time) is not safety 

critical functions.

 11.5 Survivability requirements
 System and incorporated components sh
all resist the design accidental loads to which they may be 
exposed until they
 have fulfilled their function.
 The logic solver and essential utilities shall be located as safe as possible in the accommodation or utility 
area. Reference is made to 
6.4.1
. With respect to retrofits and extensions,
 the ESD system, logic solver and 
essential utilities shall not be located less safe than existing logic solvers, i.e.
 accommodation or utility 
area.
 Final elements shall r
esist accidental loads such as explosion, fire and falling loads where applicable, e.g.:
  ESD valves including equipment such as electrical cables, pneumatic and hydraulic tubing 
necessary for activation of valves, until the 'shutdown' sequence is completed

 Emergency 
depressur
isation and Flare/Vent 
system
 12.1 Role
 The purpose of the 
emergency 
depressurisation system is to:
  reduce 
the pressure and inventory in a process segment in case of a fire exposing the seg
ment in 
question. A reduction in pressure implies reduced material stre
ss and, hence, reduced risk of 
rupture due to heating caused by the fire
; 
 reduce 
the leak rate and leak duration from a leaking process segment, and, hence, also reduce the 
explosion and fire risk in case the leak is ignited.
 The purpose of the flare/cold 
vent and atmospheric vent system is to:
  provide 
safe disposal of releases from pressure relief, depressurisation, process vents and spill
-off 
flaring from control valves
; 
 route 
gas from atmospheric vent lines to a suitable location without hazard to the pe
rsonnel 
(including occupational health) or the installation.
 12.2 Interfaces
 Depressurisation and Flare/ Vent System have interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:

6); 
 Process safety s
ystem (Clause 
10
);

 Automatic EDP functions are normally realised through the ESD system.
 12.3 Required utilities
 The EDP performance is dependent on:
  uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS) to keep the ESD and EDP system operation
al upon loss of main 
electrical power
; 
 instrument 
air supply (local accumulators if necessary) alternatively hydraulic supply.
 12.4 Functional requirements
  Emergency depressurisation
 The EDP system shall ensure that the process is depressurised in a fast and re
liable manner in order to 
avoid unacceptable rupture and to minimize leak durations. The EDP shall in combination with all other 
risk reducing measures, contribute to a reduction of the fire and explosion risk
 to:
  avoid instantaneous release (rupture and leakage) of large volumes of flammables
; 
 avoid escalation of fire
 between areas/units and during escape/rescue by reducing internal 
pressures, fire load and duration.
 The EDP rate and times shall be set based on a study reflecting the risk on the specific i
nstallation and 
principles in API STD 521. 
EDP times shall be in accordance to specified requirements for protection of 

pressurised systems exposed to fire. Analysis regarding material capacity versus EDP should be 
performed as specified in ﬁGuidelines for
 protection of pressurised systems exposed to fireﬂ, Report 
27.101.166/R1 Scandpower Risk Management AS 
[2]
 or similar methods. Reference is also made to 

subclause 
5.6.3.4
. 
The following aspects shall be considered in the design process:
  damage to internals of equipment (e.g. trays, packing supports), entrainment of packing or catalyst 
into the depressurization system
; 
 the depressurisation rates shall be maximized within a defined level of flare syst
em utilisation to 
reduce risk further and minimize the need for passive fire protection. 100
 % utilisation is normal. 
For some installations, the flare system capacity may be very large due to relief cases like choke 

collapse and mal
-operation of inlet valves. Then a lower utilisation of the flare system for 
emergency depressurisation may be correct since this will reduce noise, radiation and pipe stress 

at depressurization.
 Failure of a segregation valve impacting EDP segments shall not result in overpress
ure of
 the flare 
system.
 In case sequential EDP is required, the time delay and/or sequence to open EDP valves shall ensure that 
the flare system capacity is not exceeded and failure in the sequence shall not lead to rupture of the flare 
system. However, exceeding the radiation levels due to failure in sequence may be acceptable provided 
that the escape from exposed work areas are not impaired. Reference is also given to API
 STD
 521. 
 The EDP valves shall be treated similarly to ESD valves with respect to logic, tagging, response time etc. 

except local manual reset. The EDP valves shall be equipped with position indication (remote and local) 
and have fail
-safe open function.
 The objective is generally to avoid shut in volumes without EDP, and to minimize the
ir volumes by proper 
location of valves. All pressure vessels and piping segments, which during 
shutdown
 contain more than

 43
 1 000
 kg of hydrocarbons (liquid and/or gaseous), shall be equipped with a depressurising system. For 
pressure vessels and piping seg
ments without a depressurising system, containing gas or unstabilised oil 
with a high gas/oil
-ratio, the maximum containment should be considerably lower, typically less than 
100
 kg. Segments in this context mean volumes that are isolated by automatic 
shut
down
 valves (PSD/ESD 
valves) and non
-r
eturn valves or control valves.
 A blowdown orifice may act as a weir. Liquid that may accumulate between the EDP valve and the orifice 
shall not freeze.
 Block valves in E
DP lines shall be secured open.
 All process segm
ents without EDP shall be clearly marked on the P&IDs.
  Activation of emergency depressurisation (EDP)
 EDP 
shall be automatically initiated upon confirmed fire detection in hazardous areas (process, riser and 
wellhead areas), on fire and gas detection in riser and wellhead areas and on gas detection when deluge is 
activated (a gas leak is almost impossible to locate when deluge is released). Any delay of opening of EDP 
valves shall be accounted for in evaluations of rupture of process equipment due to fire e
xposure.
 Full platform depressurisation shall be possible in CCR (operator station and dedicated push button 
in CAP).
 Manual push buttons shall be protected against inadvertent activation, e.g. protective covers. Use 
of the dedicated push buttons shall als
o initiate ESD2.
 Automatic EDP at confirmed gas detection shall be evaluated as a mean to limit extent and duration of 
possible gas leaks. This will reduce ignition probability, and in case of an ignition, also the probability for 
rupture of process equipm
ent.
  Flare, vent and knock out drum 
 Reference is made to 
NORSOK
 P-
002 Process System Design with respect to flare, vent a
nd knock out 
drum requirements.
 Flare: 
Flare shall be located and designed to ensure that the heat radiation level at maximum or conti
nually 
release rate will be within acceptable limits in all areas of the installation. The permissible radiation 
levels for personnel exposure shall be in accordance with API STD 521. Consideration should be made to 
effect of clothing.
 Cold and local vents
: 
Vents shall be terminated at a safe location, normally verified by gas dispersion simulations. Operational 

conditions that may give gas heavier than air shall be included.
 Gas concentrations from vents (or extinguished flare) shall not exceed 20
 % LEL in
 any area on the 
installation where ignition of the release is possible. Helicopter flight paths shall be optimized and based 
on dispersion studies of release from extinguished flares, ref. CAP 437 ﬁStandards for Offshore Helicopter 
Landingﬂ regarding LEL 
levels and management system for alerting helicopter pilots.
 Unintentional ignition of the vents shall no
t give unacceptable heat loads.
 Local venting of hazardous gases should not be permitted unless it can be done without hazard to the 
personnel (includi
ng occupational health) or the installation.

 12.5 Survivability requirements
 The flare system shall withstand explosions and fires for the required period of time to minimum 
maintain integrity to avoid unacceptable rupture, ref. subclause 
5.6.3.4
. Special consideration shall be 
given to flanges, pipe supports, pipes with no flow during EDP (e.g. pipes downstream PSVs) and valves 
and control circuit with delay function. Use of pipe specification that can resist the loads should be 
con
sidered 
as an alternative to avoid PFP.
 13
 Gas detection
 13.1 Role
 The gas detection system shall monitor continuously for the presence of flammable or toxic gases, to alert 

personnel and allow control actions to be initiated manually or automatically to minimise 
the probability 
of personnel exposure, explosion and fire.
 13.2 Interfaces
 Gas detection system has interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout (Clause 
6) 
 Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD) (Clause 
11
) 
 Emergency depressurisation and flare/vent System (Clause 
12
) 
 Ignition source control (ISC) (Clause

) 
  Public address (PA), alarm and emergency communication (Clause 
18
) 
 Emergency power and lighting (Clause
19
) 
 Active fire protection (Clause 
21
) 
13.3 Require
d utilities
 Gas detection system performance is dependent on uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to keep the gas 

detection operational should main electrical power supply fail. Instrument air supply can be required if 
aspiration systems are applied.
 13.4 Functio
nal requirements
  Design coverage 
 The gas detection function shall provide reliable and fast detection of flammable and toxic leaks before a 

gas cloud reaches a concentration and size which could cause risk to personnel and installation.
 Actual design prin
ciples for gas detection (e.g. type and location of detectors) shall be established 
according to relevant gas characteristics (e.g. light/heavy, vapour, flammable, toxic).
 Detectors shall be installed based on a study of gas leakage scenarios within each area considering 

leakage sources and rate, dispersion, equipment arrangement and environmental conditions such as 
ventilation, and the probability of detection of small leakages within the area.
 The following principles should be applied for determination o
f location of detectors:
 NORSOK S-001:2018 provided by Standard Online AS for DNV GL Group Companies 2018-06-21NORSOK S
-001:2018 NORSOK

 45
  Natural flow 'corridors', e.g. access ways/walkways along flow direction, shall be covered
. 
 Where relevant, detectors shall be positioned at different heights in an area including coverage of 
different natural flow paths.
  Considera
tion shall be given to gases both lighter and heavier than air including temperature 
effects from the release.
  Location and necessary protection in view of environmental impacts such as snow, fog, sun, and 

rain/wind.
  Equipment enclosures, e.g. for noise su
ppression, shall be subject to special consideration.
 A combination of open path/line detectors and point detectors shall be used to optimize the coverage and 
detection probability.
  Hydrocarbon detectors, preferably IR detectors, with provisions of self
-di
agnostics and suited for 
the gas to be detected shall be used.
  Catalytic detectors should only be used if proper detection performance by other types is not 
achieved.
 Detector coverage should primarily be achieved using open path / line detectors and suppl
ied with point 
detectors where adequate coverage cannot be achieved with open path / line detectors. For conversion 

between open/path line and point detectors the following formula may be applied:
 Np = (L
s * C
LEL
) / (LEL
m * 100)
 Where

Number of point detecto
rs 
Ls 
Length of line of sight (m)
 CLEL
 Low alarm limit point detectors (%

 LEL
m 
Low alarm limit open path/line detectors (LELm)
 For confirmed detection of flammable gases in hazardous areas, using 20
 % LEL level, a gas cloud of 10 
meters in diameter sh
ould be detected anywhere in the area. As a practical approach for point detectors 
this can correspond to a distance of 7 meters between gas point detectors when voting is applied for 
confirmed detection.
 The basis and assumptions used for detector selecti
on and location shall be documented. Dispersion 
studies should be performed for verification and optimization of location and number of detectors.
 The detector grid coverage described above may be optimized, typically in wellhead and process areas, 

possibl
y achieving a reduction in no of detectors, by applying t
he following method and target:
 Target: A gas cloud equal to the volume of the dimensioning gas cloud (explosion loads) shall be detected 

with a 95
 % probability for confirmed detection on two detectors. The number of point detectors 
required per module is as shown in
 Figure 5
.

  Figure 5
 Š Number of gas point detectors as a function of gas cloud volume
 This figure shows number of point type detectors required to obtain 95
 % probab
ility for confirmed 
detection on two detectors as a function of the detectable gas cloud volume relative to the volume of the 
module. To determine the necessary number of point detectors in an area, the size of the dimensioning 
gas cloud should be used. Th
e vertical lines at 0,06 and 0,25 represents typical u
pper and lower gas cloud 
sizes.
 In addition, the objective shall be to provide effective detection of smaller leaks than above to give a 

warning (alarm), typically a leakage rate of 0,1
 kg/s.
 For detect
ion of vapours from process liquid releases, the following principles should apply;
  low-level detectors (heavy gas), but normally not located lower than 0,5 meters above ground level
; 
 detectors 
arranged in 5 meters triangular grid around potential source of release.
 Note that a liquefied gas release, which is relatively dense and cold, can be entrained into local air 
movements and warmed sufficiently to lift off downwind.
 Separate sensors and alarm handling shall be provided for detection of toxic gases (e.
g. H
2S, CO, CO
2, NH
3). 
For such detection, attention shall be given to the fact that hazardous effects to people and explosion 
hazard may be directly linked to both c
oncentration and exposure time.
 In wellhead and process areas, H
2S presence is related to a process (HC) gas leak. Dedicated H
2S detectors 
can be omitted for H
2S concentrations lower than 1500
 ppm in the well/process flow as the installed HC 
gas detectors can measure H
2S presence indirectly. (Activation of low HC gas alarm (e.g
. 
20
 % 
LEL) will 
be 
representative of a
n H
2S concentration of 15
 ppm i.e. corresponding to an approximate content of H
2S of 
1500
 ppm.)
 Temporary units and equipment shall be covered by gas detection in accordance with the principles in 
this document. Areas where such equipment will be located shall have connections to the platform™s Fire 
& Gas system.

  Gas detection location 
Œ Areas requiring gas detection
 Gas detectors shall be provided in all areas where potentially dangerous/toxic gas concentrations may be 
present.
 As a m
inimum the following areas shall be covered by HC detectors:
  zone 
1 and 
zone 
2 areas
; 
 ventilation 
air inlets
; 
 ventilation 
outlet from hazardous areas (except paint containers and small noise enclosures)
  combustion 
air intakes and turbine hoods/enclosures a
ir inlet/outlet
; 
 rooms 
that contain possible ignition sources and are arranged with openings towards a hazardous 
area, ref. 
15.4.3
 for further details
; 
 in sheltered or enclosed areas if gas can be trapped, e.g. noise enclosures
; 
 rooms 
containing group 3 safety critical equipment (potential ignition sources), ref. 
15.4.4
 for 
further details
; 
 for 
floating units such as FSU and FPSO, gas detection shall be provided in areas such as ballast 
tanks and cof
ferdams where gas may migrate through small cracks towards cargo tanks etc. 
Aspiration gas detector systems shall be considered for such applications.
 H2 detection shall be installed in battery rooms unless it can be documented that sufficient quantities o
f 
hydrogen cannot
 be generated to pose a danger.
 Oxygen deficiency detection shall be provided in areas where a low O
2 concentration may be present, e.g 
areas where nitrogen atmosphere may develop.
 Oil mist detectors (optical obscuration) shall be consider
ed used in areas with a risk of leak from 
pressurised liquid utility systems like diesel oi
l, hydraulic oil, lube oil etc.
 Arrangements and actions associated with gas detection should be implemented as described in 
Table 2
. 
 Gas detection actions and voting
 The gas detection system shall initiate actions in accordance with the principles
 below and the Safety 
Strategy.
 Automatic initiation of actions shall include:
  emergency shutdown (confirmed gas detection)
; 
 ignition Source dis
connection
; 
 HVAC shutdown (single low gas detection at air intake)
; 
 deluge activation in naturally ventilated areas to reduce explosion overpressure/drag forces if 
specified in Safety Strategy (confirmed gas detection)
; 
 EDP activation if specified in safet
y strategy (confirmed gas detection in hazardous area)
; 
 start of fire water pump when used for explosion mitigation (low gas detection)
; 
 general 
alarm (confirmed gas detection).
 See 
Table 2
 for further details of principles.
 Co
nfirmed gas detection and applied voting principles shall comply with the following:
  
13.4.5
). See 
0 for air intakes.
  Voting should include all detectors within a detection area (any type of detectors). Voting between 

detectors in different detection areas (inte
lligent voting) may be applied.

  Confirmed gas detection on single detector 1ooN and N > 2 may exceptionally be used provided 
failure probability is documented to be sufficiently lo
w and consequences of single detector failure 
is tolerable.
 In order to ensure optimized use of release of deluge to reduce explosion effects, initiation may be 

realized by confirmed gas detection on several detectors, e.g. by reaching low alarm limit on 
6 detectors. 
When deluge is automatically released, EDP should also be automatically activated.
 The number of detectors that may simultaneously be inhibited or in fault shall be assessed addressing 

issues such as area risk, area detection coverage, out of operation duration and compensatory measures 
including local area safety guards. Alternatively, when using a 2ooN configuration, an inhibited or faulty 
detector can be logically treated as (a) gas alarm or (b) imposing automatic reconfiguration, e.g. from 
2oo3 to 1oo2. Prerequisites and measures required in the case of detectors are inhibited or faulty shall be 
part of the operating instructions.
 1oo1 detection principle should only be used 
for area monitoring and alarms.
 Arrangements and actions associated 
with gas detection should be implemented as described in

 Notes
  a For mechanically ventilated areas special consideration shall be made, ref. HC process area (Mech ventilated) for guidance. 
 b According to 14.4.1, perform a review of potential measures which may reduce 
ignition likelihood, as an example making selective 
disconnection of essential equipment (Ex, e.g. zone 2) and Gr.1 equipment. Analyse such measures for implementation with due 

emphasis to be given on practicability for realisation, both for design as well
 as operation.
 c Group 3 equipment shall not be located in rooms safe by ventilation, ref. 
clause 
6.4.1
. 
Special consideration shall be made for LER in 
turret area. Group 3 equipment in such rooms shall be fitted with air locks a
nd as a minimum be disconnected upon loss of 
ventilation in combination with gas detection in air lock.
  
d Alarms presented in CCR shall also be presented as a not area specific general gas alarm in other strategic location such as 
crane 
cabin, drillers cabi
n and office and jack
-ups.
 e In order to ensure optimized use of release of deluge to reduce explosion effects, initiation may be realized by confirmed ga
s detection on several detectors, e.g. by reaching low alarm limit on 6 detectors. When deluge is automa
tically released, EDP should 

also be automatically activated.
 f Lifts shall not be considered as a part of escape routes. However, it shall be possible to escape from the lift at any elevat
ion. Lifts 
shall automatically go to next floor level and stop upon s
ingle gas detection
   Requirements for HC gas detection at air intakes
 Air intakes shall be monitored for presence of gas, preferably by IR type detection.
 The number and location of detectors shall be selected and installed to cover the cross
-sectional ar
ea of 
the air intake or air inlet channel since gas concentration may not be homogenous over the inlet / channel 
cross
-sectional area. This implies that large air intakes (as turbine enclosures) may require installation 
of 
minimum three gas detectors.
 Appl
ied low gas alarm shall be equal to or lower than 10
 % LEL (or equivalent for open path detectors, i.e. 
detection distance x 10
 % LELm 
- 
not > 1 LELm)
. 
Applied high gas alarm shall be equal to or lower than 30
 % LEL (or equivalent for open path detectors, 
i.e. detection distance x 30
 % LELm 
- 
not > 2 LELm)
. 
Low gas alarm (single detector) at the intake shall initiate shutdown of fans, dampers and electric 

heaters. See
 17.4.7
 Dampers with respect to response time
. 
Confirmed gas d
etection (2ooN) should be based on one detector at low alarm and one detector at high 
alarm, i.e. minimum three detectors to be installed in the air intake
. 
 Gas detection set
-points
 General alarm limits for HC and H
2 gas detection shall be equal to or lowe
r than:
  Low alarm set
-point for point detectors shall be maximum 20
 % LEL. For turbine enclosure 
detection (extract and area) the alarm limit shall be 10
 % LEL
. 
 Low alarm set
-point for IR open path / line detector shall be maximum 1
 LELm
. 
 High alarm set
-point for point detectors shall be maximum 30
 % LEL.
 For turbine enclosure 
detection the alarm limit shall be 15
 % LEL (extract and area
). 
 High alarm set
-point for IR open path/line detector shall be maximum 2
 LELm
. 
If toxic gas detection is required, separa
te outputs for annunciation of toxic gas alarm shall be provided. 
The following alarm limits for toxic gas shall be used:

 H2S gas detection:
  Low alarm set point shall be maximum 5
 ppm (assume area inspection and reporting within 
15
 minutes)
. 
 High alarm set
 point shall be maximum 50
 ppm (immediate area evacuation, 50
 % of standard 
IDLH value).

  Low alarm set point shall be maximum 5
 000
 ppm.
  High alarm set point shall be maximum 15
 000
 ppm.
 CO gas detection:
  Low alarm set point shall be maximum 100
 ppm (assume area inspection and reporting within 
15
 minutes
, reference standards allows 25
 ppm for 8 hours)
. 
 High alarm
 set point shall be maximum 600
 ppm
 (immediate area evacuation, 50
 % of standard 
IDLH value).
 O2 deficiency detection (see IEC
 6
0079
-29
-2):
  Low alarm 
set
-point shall be minimum 19,5
 vol
 %. 
 Low
-lo
w alarm set
-point shall be 19,0
 vol
 %. 
 Gas detection alarms
 F&G system status shall be continuously available in CCR, and the system shall raise alarms in CCR for 
operator awareness or acti
on, considering:
  Gas detection
  Failure to execute action upon demand
  Function (sensor, logic solver, final element) defect or failure.
 Status/alarm parameters for each individual gas detector shall be identifiable in the CCR.
 Gas alarms shall also be announced at other strategic locations, e.g.:
  drillers cabin and office
  crane cabin
  jack
-ups.
 For alarms from detectors located in drilling areas the information presented in CCR should be mirrored 

in drillers cabin and drillers control office.
  Gas detection response time
 Maximum response time of the gas detection function shall be defined in order to ensure that total 

reaction time for each safety function can be fulfilled.
 Typical response times that should be complied with unless faster responses are specifie
d elsewhere:
  IR detector response time (T90) should be less than 5 s for general area applications, and less than 
2 s if used in HVAC ducting
. 
 the time from detector alarm limit is reached until alarm is presented on operator station and start 

of action sh
ould be less than 2
 s. NORSOK S-001:2018 provided by Standard Online AS for DNV GL Group Companies 2018-06-21NORSOK S

 There shall be no predefined delays of actions initiated upon gas detection unless a delay is safer. In such 
a case, this shall be clearly identified in relevant documentation such as FPDS and C&E diagrams.
 For gas detection in venti
lation inlets IR type detector shall be located as close as possible to the inlet to 
ensure fast detection. For damper and ventilation shut off response time reference is made to 
17.4.7
. 
 Gas detection logic solver
 The logic sol
ver (firmware, as standard manufacturer provision) shall be in compliance with IEC
 61508/
 IEC
 61511 and Norwegian Oil and Gas Association GL070.
  Independence
 The F&G safety related functions shall 
fulfil
 their intended role independently of other control 
- 
and safety 
related control systems. Prerequisites to 
fulfil
 the independence requirements are:
  F&G safety related functions shall be realised in addition to and independent of installation basic 
control systems.
  F&G system units (logic solver) shall only 
be used for F&G related safety functions.
  F&G sensor loop including accessories (e.g. air supply branch
-off and power fuses) shall be separate 
from other functions that are directly connected to F&G system unit.
  F&G final element shall be operated directly
 from F&G system unit. Disconnection of 
ignition
 sources should be realized through the ESD system.
 A common SAS data network and operator stations may be used allowing F&G operator interface 
activities to be executed such as inhibit and override, status a
nd alarm handling, annunciation, logging 
and printing. ﬁAll action signals, except release of firefighting systems (deluge, foam, watermist etc), shall 

be normally energized.
 13.5 Survivability requirements
 The logic solver and essential utilities shall be located as safe as possible in the accommodation or utility 

area. Reference is made to 
6.4.1
. With respect to retrofits and extensions, the, logic solver and essential 
utilities shall not be located less safe than existing logic so
lvers, i.e. accommodation or utility area.

 Fire detection
 14.1 Role
 The fire detection system shall monitor continuously for the presence of a fire to alert personnel and 
allow control actions to be initiated manually or automatically to minimise the likelihood
 of fire 
escalation and probability of personnel exposure.
 The early fire detection system shall, relevant to specific equipment and areas, monitor continuously for 

the presence of an incipient fire condition to alert personnel and allow control actions to
 be initiated 
manually to minimise the probability of a fire condition to develop.
 14.2 Interfaces
 Fire detection system has interfaces with the following safety systems and barriers:

 14.3 Required utilities
 Fire detection system performance is dependent on uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to keep fire 
detection operational should main electrical power supply fail.
 14.4 Functional requirements
  Design cover
age 
The fire detection function shall provide reliable and fast detection of a fire by adequate type, number and 

location of fire detectors and shall ensure timely alarm and initiation of control actions
. 
Detectors shall be provided based on an evaluation 
of fire scenarios within each area considering 
potential fire sources and characteristics, consequences, area and equipment arrangement and 
environmental conditions. For fire detector requirements reference is made to EN
 54 all parts.
 Fire detection covera
ge in each area shall be based on flame size, smoke characteristics and temperature 
(heat) rise.
 The target for critical fire (jet or pool) detection in hazardous areas:
  A flame size of 0,5
 m in diameter and length of 1
 m to be detected by at least one det
ector.
  A flame size of 1
 m in diameter and length of 3
 m to be detected by at least two detectors 
(corresponding to an ignited jet gas leakage rate of 0
,1 
kg/s).
 When suitable according to area conditions and fire characteristics, flame detectors shall be 
given 

preference over heat sensors.
 Early warning smoke detection systems, sensitive to small concentration of combustion products, should 

be considered in rooms containing live electrical equipment and where firefighting is based upon local 
inspection and
 manual intervention
 including disconnection of
 relevant electrical equipment.
 The basis and assumptions used for detector selection and location shall be documented. One detector 

should be located at the HVAC extract points. The location of smoke detector
s in LERs and critical rooms 
shall be confirmed by smoke dispersion tests for actual conditions inside the rooms with ventilation 

operative. Scenarios to be detected and performance requirements shall be defined in the Safety Strategy.
 Equipment enclosures, e.g. for noise suppression, shall be subject to special consideration. See subclause 
6.4.1
. 
 Fire detection location 
Œ areas requiring fire detection
 All areas on the installation shall have suitable means of fire detection. Fire detection shall as a minimum 
be in accordance with
 Table 3
.

 Flame detectors should be the primary means for detection of fires in hazardous areas.
 Detectors in one fire area shall not detect fires in adjacent fire areas and thereby cause unintended 
automatic release of fire water which may exceed the di
mensioning fire water capacity.
 Flame detectors shall be located in a manner that minimises the likelihood of false fire alarms being 
initiated, e.g. avoiding 
direct exposure to flame radiation from sources such as flares or reflections from 
shiny surfaces.
  Manual 
call 
points
 Manual Call Points shall be located strategically, and in locations such as:
  along 
escape routes
; 
 inside 
buildings such as offices etc.
; 
 exits from process areas and rooms
; 
 exits 
from technical rooms
; 
 at fire stations
; 
 refrigerator 
and freezer rooms/containers.
 The maximum walking distance to a manual call point should not exceed 30 m.
 Manual call points should be protected against inadverte
nt activation.
 Manual call points are used to alert CCR for accidents or situations also other than fire and where the 
attention and action of CCR is required.
 Release of firefighting equipment is realized via dedicated 
stations, ref. clause 
21
. 
 Characteristics and calibration
 Detector characteristics and calibration (pre
-set sensitivity) shall ensure detection of a fire condition at 
an early stage, and the detector shall be capable of operating under the conditions at the time 
that fire 

detection is needed.
 Fire detectors shall be self
-monitoring and should include provisions of 
sel
f-d
iagnostic
 to the extent 
available.
 Flame detectors shall comply with actual fire potential and environment conditions within the relevant 

area e.g
.:  IR or UV where flame is predominating and according to flame wave radiation characteristic
; 
 sensor 
range and cone of vision. Based on a typical flame detector characteristic, the distance 
between flame detectors and targets monitored should not exceed 2
6 m; 
 sensor 
direction and angle
; 
 sensitivity 
to external impact such as arc welding and burner boom
. 
Heat point detectors (electrical) characteristics shall comply with actual fire potential and environmental 
conditions within the relevant area, e.g.:
  normally 
limited use, i.e. specific high
-risk areas and where other detection principles are not 
suitable
; 
 maximum 
coverage in naturally ventilated area approximate 24

ire potential and environmental conditions 
within the relevant area, e.g.:
  optical detectors used for smouldering fires
; 
 combined heat and smoke detectors used for energy intensive smoke generating fires, e.g. explosive 
fire in high voltage switchgear
; 
 smo
ke detectors located in areas such as suspended ceilings and raised floors shall
 have remote 
indication on VDU;
  early warning sensor specified with higher sensitivity (0
,4 % to 0
,8 % light obscuring per metre) 
than norm recommendation
; 
 maximum distance bet
ween sensors 11 m, maximum distance from sensor to bulkhead 5.5 m and 
minimum 0
,5 m away from outside wall or dividing partition.
  Fire detection actions and voting
 Main principles for actions initiated upon fire detection are as follows:
  ESD2 (confirmed fire in hazardous areas)
; 
 emergency 
depressurisation (confirmed fire in hazardous areas)
;  
 HVAC and fire damper shutdown except for areas subject to smoke control (confirmed fire)
; 
 activation 
of Firefighting Equipment (confirmed fire)
;  
 General Alarm (confir
med fire detection)
; 
 Start Fire Water Pump (fire alarm in areas requiring fire water).
 See
 Table 3
 for further details.
 A fire alarm shall be raised upon activation of any fire detector, and confirmed fire should be based on 

voting between two or more fire detectors in alarm. Confirmed fire detection and applied voting principle 
for automatic actions shall be defined in the Safety Strategy. Manual release of deluge from pushbutton 

may be regarded as confirmed fire apart from 
ini
tiation
 of EDP, ref. 
Figure 4
 in 
subclause
 11.4.3
.  The following voting principles should generally apply:
  Smoke (except areas such as accommodation):
 o 2ooN detectors to reach specif

 NOTE
 Smoke detectors are less likely to be used together with other types of fire detectors, and 
applications that require voting are not common. Smoke detectors covering enclosures and their 

HVAC inlets shall not be voted toge
ther.
  Flame:
 o 2ooN detectors to reach sp

  Heat:
 o 1ooN detectors to reach s

 Voting should include all fire detectors within a detection area exposed to the same fire scenario.
 The number of detectors that m
ay simultaneously be inhibited or in fault shall be assessed addressing 
issues such as area risk, area detection coverage, out of operation duration and compensatory measures 
including local area safety guards. Alternatively, when using a 2ooN configuratio
n, an inhibited or faulty 
detector can be logically treated as fire alarm imposing automatic reconfiguration, e.g., 2oo3 to 1oo2.

uch as the ESD system, and ISC 
interfaces are incorporated within the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout (Clause 
6); 
 Emergency 
shutdown
 (ESD)
 (Clause 
11
); 
 Gas detection (Clause 
12
);
  Fire detection (Clause 
14
);  Human 
Œ machine interface (HMI) for CCR systems (Clause 
16
); 
 Natural ventilation and heating, ventilation and air condition (HVAC)
 (Clause 
17
); 
 Public address (PA), alarm and emergency communication (Clause 
18
);

 15.3 Required utilities
 No particular utilities 
are 
required for the ISC function.
 15.4 Functional re
quirements
  General
 The technical requirements of subclause 
15.4.2
 to 
15.4.4
 below apply to ISC including different types of 
measures to reduce ignition probability of
 an explosive atmosphere occurring in both hazardous and non
-hazardous areas.
 Area classification shall be established in accordance with IEC 61892
-7 and IEC 60079
-10
-1 or EI 15.
 A systematic mapping of all potential ignition sources both electrical and no
n-
electrical, shall be 
performed, including risk assessment and implementation of necessary risk reduction measures in order 
to reduce ignition probability of an explosive atmosphere occurring in both hazardous and non
-hazardous areas. Reference is made to
 EN 1127
-1. The equipment shall be categorized as non
-essential, 
essential and safety critical equipment respectively.
 Equipment shall be constructed, installed, operated and maintained in accordance with ATEX 
requirements (see FOR
-1996
-12
-09
-1242 
[6]
) and standards IEC
 61892 and ISO
 80079
-36. The 
equipment shall be certified by an accredited test institution according to, as a minimum, the lowest 
explosion protection level accepted for use in the particular zone by the reference standard.
 For Zone 2 areas (ATEX category 3), non
-certified equipment that is constructed according to recognized 
manufacturing standards may be used. This is provided that in normal operation the equipment does not 
generate surface temperatures equal to
 or greater than the ignition temperature of the gas in question, 
nor produce arcs or sparks capable of causing an ignition of the gas. The foregoing is contingent upon the 

application of relevant standards such as IEC 60079
-14 
Annex I a
nd EN 1127
-1 and in
cluding an 
assessment of potential area risk. The equipment in question shall, as a minimum, be supported by a 

declaration of conformity which is verified by an independent documented review. However, this 
approach is an option only where certified equipme
nt is not commercially available.
 Equipment (electrical and non
-electrical) installed in non
-hazardous naturally ventilated areas and at 
ventilation inlets (e.g. fan, damper and heaters) and outlets shall, as a minimum, comply with a level of 
explosion pro
tection according to hazardous area zone 2 requirements.
 If not available, the equipment 
shall be disconnected in accord
ance with the principles below.
 Possible technical malfunction of Ex equipment shall be taken into account. To reduce explosion risk as 
far as practical, also Ex
-equipment should be electrically isolated on relevant gas detection. 
The intent of 
this requirement may be met by measures such as disconnection / isolation of equipment compliant with 
15.4.2
 or 
15.4.3
 at an earliest possible stage of a hazard.
 Combustion type of equipment that may cause an ignition hazard due to flames, hot gases or hot particles 

shall not be installed in hazardous areas. Irr
espective of location, diesel engines shall be provided with 
flame arrestor in the combustion inlet, overspeed protection (close combustion air damper and fuel 

valve) and spark arrestor. Flame arrestor may be omitted for non
-essential equipment located in 
utility 
area and tripped on single gas anywhere on the installation. Additional measures to consider are isolation 

of non
-Ex protected components and maintaining hot surfaces below auto
-ignition temperature (ref. 
subclause
 15.4.
5). If located in a mechanically ventilated room, the combustion air shall be taken from 
non
-hazardous area outside the room and minimum 3
 m from any zone 2 boundaries 
to reduce ignition 
probability.

 NORSOK 
© 2018
 Electrical isolation shall be defined as disconnection 
of the power feeder cable at the distribution boards. 
For simplification and reliability of the isolation function, the numbers of breakers to be tripped should 
be minimized, e.g. trip the inlet feeder.
 Use of temporary equipment connected to EX socket out
lets which is not subject to trip on low gas 
alarm/ESD 2, shall have appropriate marking to ensure that equipment is disconnected according to
 the 
principles in this clause.
 Boost charging of batteries shall be stopped automatically upon loss of ventilatio
n in the battery room or 
detection of hydrogen gas in the room.
 Hydrogen detection can be omitted if it can be documented that 
sufficient quantities o
f hydrogen cannot be generated.

  Safety critical equipment (electrical and n
on-electrical)
 15.4.4.1
 General
 This category will consist of:
  non-ex equipment (group 3)
; 
 ex equipment
. 
Safety critical equipment not 
shutdown
 by an APS (after initiation plus time delay) shall irrespective of 
location comply with hazardous area zone 1 requirement
 if located outdoors. This includes escape 
lighting (also muster, lifeboat station and lifeboat drop zone) and navigation aids (sea and air) including 
battery/UPS supply. However, centrally located batteries/UPS power supplies and distribution system 

locat
ed in accordance with principles in 
6.4.1
 may comply with area zone 2 requirement. 
Alternatively,
 to 
zone 2 requirement for the UPS, is to arrange the two separate systems, A and B, such that the need for 

igniti
on source isolation of both systems is minimised. Consideration will then have to be made to the 
ventilation damper setup for the escape lighting battery rooms, individual dampers, to minim
ize 
probability of gas ingress.
 The emergency generator shall be tr
ipped immedi
ately upon APS (no time delay).
 Equipment supplied from UPS shall meet the following:
 15.4.4.2
 Hazardous area:
 Equipment located in such areas shall meet relevant zone requirements and shall be tripped after time 
delayed APS.
 15.4.4.3
 Non-hazardous naturally ven
tilated areas:
 Equipment located in such areas shall meet minimum zone 2 and shall be tripped after time delayed APS.

. 
 Natural ventilation in hazardous areas
 Open hazardous areas with natural ventilation is the preferred solution for off
shore installations
. 
Location and sizes for ventilation openings and louvers shall be optimised to maximize ventilation rates. 
Consideration shall in addition be made to maintain acceptable working environment /weather 
protecti
on for personnel and equipmen
t. Ventilation rates in hazardous areas shall as a minimum be 12 AC/h for 95
 % of the time. Stagnant zones 
should be avoided.
 Natural ventilation shall be documented by studies and/or model testing. Thermal effects may be 

considered when calculating natural ventilation rates for hazardous areas.
 Equipment enclosures, eg. for noise suppression, shall be subject to special consideration. See subclause
s 
6.4.1
 and 
17.4.6
. 
 Mechanical venti
lation in hazardous areas
 A ventilation rate to ensure minimum 12
 AC/h shall be provided. Stagnant zones should be avoided. 
Ventilation shall be maintai
ned in the event of a gas leak.
 The ventilation system shall ensure high availability, e.g., by using re
dundant fans.

 Adequate ventilation shall be monitored by fan operation or low air flow in the ventilation duct to the 
individual areas. Time delayed ESD2 upon loss of mechanical vent
ilation may be c
onsidered. 
Lower ventilation rates may be acceptable when possible leakages can be sufficiently diluted as 

documented in specific studies. When calculating the gas release rate resulting from an oil leak, the 
evaporation effect should be ta
ken into account, and not only the flash release.
  Mechanical ventilation in non
-hazardous areas with internal leakage sources
 Ventilation shall be maintained in the event of an internal gas leak. To maintain non
-hazardous status 
ventilation rates shall correspond to the relevant area classification calculations in areas with an internal 
leakage source, e.g. turbine enclosures, battery rooms, gas analyser houses.
 The ventilation system shall ensure high availability, e.g., using redundant fans of 2x100
 % or 
3x50
 % 
capacity, duty/standby.
 Turbine enclosures shall have a fixed over
- 
or underpressure dependent on location (underpressure 
when located in an unclassified area and overpressure when located in a hazardous area).
 Equipment not suitable for zone 2 in a
reas with high ventilation shall automatically be disconnected upon 
loss of ventilation. Monitoring and control to be realised as a SIF, e.g., by F&G system or as realised 
otherwise through ATEX certification.
 Alarm shall be given in CCR upon low air flow 
monitored by adequate fan operation or low air flow 

measured in main ventilation duct.

-hazardous rooms with access to hazardous areas, see IEC
 61892
-7. The self
-closing door shall open into the n
on-hazardous r
oom.
 Alarm shall be given in CCR upon loss of ventilation. Alarm shall be given in CCR upon direct 
measurement of 25
 Pa overpressure relative to surrounding classified areas. 
Alternatively,
 alarm shall be 
given both upon loss of airflow, corr
esponding to 25 Pa, and time delayed indication of open door. The 
flow or pressure differential signal shall be routed to the safety related part of SAS, initiating loss of 
ventilation alarm and if required 
activating automatic
 disconnection of ignition sources, see 
subclause
 15.4.3
. 
The air change rate shall be minimum 5
 AC/h with redundant fans.
  Mechanical ventilation in areas non
-hazardous by location

 ignition 
probability.
 Equipment in ventilation inlets and outlets shall be provided in accordance with clause 
15
 in order to 
ensure that such equipment does not become an ignition source during accidental events.
 Measures shal
l 
be taken, to avoid accumulation of ice and snow. Studies should be made to locate main ventilation inlets 
to minimize e
xposure to smoke and gas leaks.
 The distance between air inlet and outlet from haza
rdous areas shall be such that:
  Gas from the outlet 
cannot en
ter the air inlet.
  Smoke from the outlet cannot enter the air inlet during active smoke control.
 Considerations should be made when locating LQ ventilation outlets to prevent exposure of helicopter 
deck from exhaust smoke during active smoke contr
ol. 
Ventilation systems serving hazardous and non
-hazardous areas shall be independent of each other.
 All 
ventilation outlets from non
-hazardous areas shall be into non
-hazardous areas.
 The inlet ducts should normally not pass through a hazardous area. Whe
re this cannot be avoided, the 
supply fan unit should be located in the non
-hazardous area (i.e at the inlet side) in order to secure that 
the pressure in the ducts supplying the room or equipment enclosure is higher than the external 

pressure, or adequate
 precautions should be taken to ensure that the ducts are free from leaks.
  
An exception may be made for ventilation intakes and outlets to smaller enclosures for process 

equipment that is located within a classified hazardous area.
 For these enclosures, it may be acceptable to

. 
 Dampers
 Dampers shall provide qu
ick, reliable and effective means to prevent ingress or spreading of gas or 
smoke.
 A fire damper and smoke ventilation strategy shall be established for operation of dampers for both high 
and low risk areas, see 
NORSOK
 H-
003.
 Gas tight dampers shall be ins
talled 
in HVAC inlets and outlets.
 If gas and/or smoke are detected at ventilation air inlets, the ventilation fan in question shall be stopped, 
all inlet 
and outlet 
dampers shall be closed and the heating element shut off via F&G or ESD.
 In rooms where ig
nition sources are kept energised, hydrocarbon gas detection in the ventilation inlets 
shall ensure that a possible gas cloud is detected and dampers closed before a dangerous concentration 
can reach the ventilated areas.
 The total response time for closin
g of HVAC inlet dampers shall not exceed 6 s, i.e. from gas detector 
reaches alarm limit.
 Dampers and fans shall be interlocked to avoid abnormal pressure configurations.
 Ventilation (supply air and air outlet) shall continue upon internal fire in low risk
 areas.
 Fire
-dampers shall be closed automatically by signal from the F&G
-system and by ﬁfusible linkﬂ 
where 
specified. Confirmed closed fire damper position shall be monitored from the CCR
. 
 Survivability requirements
 The system and components shall be des
igned and protected to ensure that it will remain operative 
during incidents where the system has a role or form a safety barrier.
 The need for ventilation in rooms containing safety critical equipment (e.g. UPS, emergency 
communication rooms, CCR) shall be determined, including considerations of aspects such as 
temperature rise in case of HVAC trip.
 HVAC system having a safety role shall be fed by emergency power to cater for loss of main power supply. 

The 
safety role typically includes:
  the 
need to mainta
in overpressure
; 
 general 
ventilation of safety critical rooms, e.g. emergency communication room and CCR
; 
 temperature 
control of safety critical equipment e.g., UPS, emergency communication equipment 
and CCR equipment. Dedicated room cooling units may have
 to be used to ensure 
adequate
 temperature control upon loss of ventilation to the room.

 Passive fire protection (PFP) shall ensure that relevant structures, piping and equipment components 

have adequate fire resistance with regard to load bearing properties, integrity and insulation properties 

during a design fire, and contribute in reduci
ng the consequences in general.
 20.2 Interfaces
 No sp
ecific interfaces, but the extent and requirement for passive fire protection is dependent on the 
design and performance of the following safety systems and barriers:
  Layout (Clause 
6);

 20.4 Functional requirements
  Fire divisions
 Fire divisions shall as a minimum separate the main areas, unless it is proven that separation by distance 
is sufficient. Fire division between drilling and wellhead area may be omitted if escape from drilling is 
ensur
ed and activation and survivability of BOP is secured. However, well hatches shall be secured and 
withstand design explosion loads.
 The extension of a fire division should be assessed with respect to exposure of personnel and critical 
equipment in neighbou
ring areas.
 Areas with important safety functions and areas with a high fire risk shall be separated from the 

surroundings by adequate fire divisions. CCR, FW pump systems, LER/LIR with safety functions, 
emergency power supply with related distribution equipment and fuel tank shall be protected from the 
surroundings by minimum Class A
-60 fire divisions. Cement units and associated equipment required for 
emergency operation (kill function) shall be protected from fire events to which they can be exposed.
 Fir
e divisions between fires areas exposed to HC fires shall remain intact with regard to the thermal loads 
and their duration to which they are subjected in the event of a design fire and shall be rated according to 
H-
class. LER/LIRs without a safety functio
n can be separated with Class A
-0 even if exposed to HC fires. 
Fire divisions shall withst
and the design accidental load.
 Generators (including prime mover), transformers, LER/LIR without safety function, rooms for 
ventilation equipment and equipment used 
for storage of flammable commodities or easily ignitable 
material shall be separated from the surroundings with at least Class A
-0 fire divisions.
 Penetrations, e.g. for ventilation ducts, piping, drain boxes, cables, beams as well as windows and doors in 

fire divisions, shall not reduce the fire and explosion integrity of such divisions. Penetrations do not need 
to be certified for fire durations exceeding two hours. Penetrations should be minimized in fire divisions 
between main areas. Doors in fire divis
ions s
hall be of a self
-closing type.
 For fire divisions without PFP, the unexposed side can become very hot in a fire situation. It shall be 

documented that the high radiation load that may result from this is acceptable.
 If passive fire protection is use
d on only one side of a fire division, and that division is exposed from the 
unprotected side, the PFP will cause the temperature to become significantly higher than for an 
unprotected division. This means that PFP on only one side shall be avoided if ther
e is a fire risk from 
both sides.
 For horizontal divisions, PFP on the upper side may lead to practical problems. PFP on such divisions 

shall not be implemented without assessing the total risk impact. If PFP is needed for maintaining the 
integrity of such
 divisions, it may be sufficient to use PFP only on the girder system.
  Load bearing structures
 Load bearing structures/important ele
ments shall have adequate fire 
protection t
o 
prevent unacceptable 
deformations or collapse during a design fire, reference is made to subclause 
7.5
. 
Fire protection materials used in outdoor areas should be suitable for the environmenta
l conditions it 

may exposed to.
 If the contact area including the 
cross
-sectional
 area inside hollow sections of an
 unprotected structural 
element is equal or larger than 1000
 mm2, or for several attachments with at total contact area of 
1000
 mm2 pe
r square meter of fireproofed (main) structural elements, the need for coatback shall be 
evaluated. It is not expected that the coatback distance in any case needs to be more than 150
 mm.

  Vessels and piping
 Pressurized vessels, process equipment and piping including supports shall have adequate fire resistance 
to prevent unacceptable ruptures (see subclause 
5.6.3.4
). For such equipment and piping consideration 
shall be given to deformations / movement of deck, walls and structural elements caused by explosion 
and fire loads.
 Analysis of rupture of process equipment and objects when exposed to fire due to overpressure and 

material weakening should be performed as specified in ﬁGuidelines for protection of pressurised 
systems exposed to fireﬂ, Report 27.101.166/R1 Scandpower Risk Management AS 
[2]
 or similar 
methods.
 Adequ
ate protection of process equipment, piping and instrument tubing in a fire situation can be 
obtained by either one of or a combination of following measures: emergency depressurisation, increased 

wall thickness, material selection and passive fire pro
tect
ion.
 Passive fire protection of process vessels and piping shall as far as possible be avoided, due to several 

negative aspects regarding safety such as corrosion problems, increased dimensions on equipment 
(increasing explosion pressures and drag loads) a
nd maintenance issues.
 The bolts and nuts of flanges are weak points, and the need for passive fire protection on these to avoid 

unacceptable ruptures, shall be evaluated. Bolts on flanges on liquid nozzles from large vessels, more than 
4 tons of hydrocarb
on liquid, should be protected. The protection of these shall be kept as inspection and 
maintenance friendly as possible.
 Reference is made to subclauses 
8.4.4
 and 
8.5
 for fire protection to prevent
 escalation
 to risers.
  Safety critical equipment
 Equipment intended to function during a fire shall have adequate fire protection. This includes 
consideration of possible deflections of supporting structures.
 Requirements for fire protection and the use of
 PFP shall be assessed in relation to safety criticality and 
the fire risk in the area. This applies to protection of equipment such as:
  safety critical 
cables, junction boxes and trays (to equipment which is to operate after ignited leaks, 
e.g. ESD system
, fire detection of adjacent areas, FW pumps)
; 
 safety 
critical pipe supports (such as active fire protection, flare/vent lines)
; 
 safety 
critical ducting (needed during a fire)
; 
 ESD and EDP valves and activation system
; 
 flare-
/vent lines (to be considered a
ccording to subclause 
20.4.3
); 
 dry 
fire water piping exposed to fire, ref. subclause 
21.5
. 
 Non-combustible materials
 Materials used in areas that may be exposed to a hydrocarbon fire shall be non
-combustible. If it is 
justified from safety point of view to make use of materials that do not meet the requirements to non
-combustibility, such materials shall have limited flame
-spread properties, low smoke development, heat 
generation and toxicity of gas emitted in the event of a fire.
 Documentation shall be available to support 
the basis for the decision regarding selection of materials.

the surfaces can be exposed to a hydrocarbon fire a minimum class H
-60 is required (f
rom process or 
wellhead areas).
 Choice of materials and interior design of the office/accommodation sp
aces shall be based on fire risk. If 
surface treatment of paint or other coating is used, the properties of the product with regard to flame
-
spread shall be considered. A corresponding evaluation shall also be carried out with regard to textiles. 
These eva
luations are particularly important for LQ without water sprinkler protection
. 
All materials 
shall have limited flame
-spread properties, low smoke development, heat generation and toxicity of gas 
emitted in the event of a fire.

21.3 Required utilities
 The performance of the firefighting sy
stems typica
lly depends on the:
  emergency 
power system (for electrical foam
- 
and fire water pump systems without dedicated 
diesel drivers, i.e. power from emergency generator, other installation or shore)
; 
 instrument 
air system (back
-up instrument air for local accumulators, if necessary)
. 
21.4 Functional requirements
  General
 Fixed 
firefighting
 systems shall be installed in areas representing a major fire risk, and particularly cover 
equipment containing significant quantities of hydrocarbons or other flammable materials.

particular areas (for example, the effects of water on electrical equipment).
  Fire water supply system
 The fire water system capacity shall be suffici
ent at any time to cover the area with the largest FW 
demand plus the adjacent fire area with largest demand, plus two hydrants and, when applicable, fire 
water / emergency generator cooling. This capacity shall be achieved with one pump out of operation. 
This will ensure sufficient capacity in the event that a pump fails to start and in addition that the fire 
water is released in the largest neighbouring fire area.
 Consideration shall also be made in the design for 
degradation of the pump performance to en
sure sufficient pump system capacity at all times. The 
capacity requirement premises an optimized fire detection avoiding release in neighbouring areas, 
ref. 
14.4.2
. 
The FW ring main shall be dimensioned for the demand of the l

ring main closed and for any FW pump configuration running, and for the demand of both the largest fire 
area and the largest neighbouring area without any sections closed off.
 The FW ring main shall be water filled 
and pressurised in the standby mode. The pressure source, 

typically a jockey pump, shall have the capacity of flow through frost protection bleed lines plus two 
hydrant hoses. Consideration should be made to include capacity to helideck in order to meet th
e response time requirement, ref. subclause 
21.4.9
. 
The FW ring main sectioning valves shall be installed ensuring supply to consumers from two different 

sections allowing maintenance of the 
firefighting
 systems.
 The valves sha
ll be easily accessible, car 
sealed 
open and clearly marked.
 If needed the FW ring main shall be equipped with two points (minimum 6 in) for connection to external 
water supply for commissioning. SOLAS international shore couplings should be used.
 The magn
itude and effects of pressure surges shall be minimised. Measures such as water filled FW pump 
risers, air relief valve and vacuum breakers shall be considered.
 Screen at seawater inlet and strainer shall be installed upstream of ring main. The need for st
rainer 
between suction screen and pump shall be considered. The inlet arrangement shall be designed to ensure 
that the FW pumps also can function at 150
 % of rated capacity.

aspects such as reliability, configuration, ignition source control and survivability.
 There shall be a starting sequence logi
c for the start
-up of the FW pumps in accordance with NFPA 20. 
Duration of each start attempt does not have to comply with NFPA 20. This includes
  individual FW pump engine sequence logic (repetitive start attempts
);
  start of duty pumps on single low gas de
tection when used for explosion mitigation
; 
 start of duty pumps on fire detection, see 
Table 3
; 
 start of FW pump upon loss of ring main system pressure. There shall be a minimum of two 

pressure transmitters in the FW ring main 
providing the low
-pressure start signal to the FW pump 
system. The transmitters shall be located in different sections of the ring main

 Escape and Evacuation 
 22.1 Role
  Escape routes and exits
 In the case of a hazardous incident, t
he purpose of escape route is to:
  ensure that personnel may leave the area(s) in question by at least one safe route
; 
 enable personnel to safely reach the assigned mustering area from any position on the installation 
they are likely to occupy (and hence the designated embarkation area)
; 
 enable rescue/medical teams to safely bring injured personnel to areas where medical treatment 
can be given

  Mustering areas
 The purpose of mustering areas is to:
  provide safe refuge on the installation as long as required f
or a controlled evacuation to be carried 
out; 
 ensure easy, fast and safe entering of the evacuation systems in question
. 
 Evacuation systems
 The purpose of the evacuation system(s) is to ensure safe means of eva
cuating the maximum POB.

in the direction of escape without blocking the outside route, and be se
lf-
closing. This requirement should 
consider the effect of wind (1
 year condition), list (typically 17° for floating installations) and snow/ice 
conditions.
 Escape from electrical rooms and from non
-hazardous rooms with access to hazardous areas requires 
special consideration. Ref IEC 61892
-6 para 9.4, and subclause 
17.4.4

 Evacuation 
systems
 22.4.2.1
 General principles
 Requirements relating to safe evacuation shall be met by using a combination of means of evacuation.
 The preferred methods of evacuation for installations that are not bridge connected to a neighbouring 

installation are in prioritised order:
 1)
 Helicopter (if possible in an accidental scenario)
 2)
 Free
-fall lifeboats
 3)
 Escape chute with life rafts
 For installati
ons connected by bridge to other installations and/or floating accommodation installations 
that are safe in the design accidental event, the bridge should be the primary means of evacuation.
 Number, size and location of evacuation means shall be established based on manning, risk analyses (e.g. 
risk exposure of muster area and escape routes towards this area) and safety strategy.
 There shall be sufficient emergency lighting of the sea surface to ensure safe launching of evacuation 

means in darkness, ref. su
bclause 
19.4.5
. 
22.4.2.2
 Lifeboats
 The minimum number of free
-fall lifeboats in the main evacuation area available during a design 
accidental event shall correspond to the maximum number of personnel (100
 %) on board plus one 
additional 
boat to compensate for unavailability (technical failure when required). This may also allow a 
staged evacuation, e.g. minimum crew to leave last. The maximum number of personnel on board shall 

include day visitors and shuttle personnel in transit (waitin
g for helicopter in sky lobby), but excluding 
crew change when helicopter is on deck. One lifeboat can be taken out of service for lifeboat maintenance 

provided that risk reducing measures are implemented, such as activity restrictions for work on 
hydrocar
bon equipment. For floating installations, it shall be possible to launch lifeboats with capacity for 
all persons on board at the least favourable angle of heel specified in the stability calculations combined 

with weather conditi
on with one year return pe
riod.
 Free fall lifeboats shall comply with DNVGL
-ST-E406: Design of Free Fall Lifeboats.
 All free
-fall lifeboats shall be launched as part of commissioning using design drop height, angle and 
weight. Equivalent test methods may be accepted as long as the relevant functionality is demonstrated.

  should 
have eme
rgency power for power supply to lifeboats. The disconnection point should be in 
the vicinity of the lifeboat and disconnection shall be automatic without sparks when dropping or 

lowering the lifeboat
; 
 disconnection and launching mechanism should be consid
ered
 to be 
winterised
 to prevent ice from 
interfering with the launching
; 
 winch for recovery 
of lifeboat from sea 
should be fed by main power
; 
 access ways should be provided with anti
-skid coating
; 
 shall be equipped with:
 o lifeboat 
navigation 
assistance sys
tem (LNA), i.e. a navigational assistance tool (gyro heading

 Well integrity 
 26.1 Role
 The below subchapters for Well
 integrity 
give some principle safety 
requirements and guidance
. Reference is made to NORSOK D
-001 and NO
RSOK D
-010 for further details.
 Well integrity implies that uncontrolled flow from the well to the surroundings is prevented at all times.
 26.2 Interfaces
 The well barriers interface the following safety systems:
  Emergency shut down (ESD)
 (Clause 
11
); 
 Gas detection (Clause 
13
);
  Fire detection (Clause 
14
);  Human 
Œ machine in
terface (HMI) for 
CCR 
or other control stations (Clause 
16
); 
 Public address (PA), alarm and emergency communication (Clause 
18
); 
 Passive fire protection (PFP) (Clause
 20
); 
 Active Fire Protection (Clause 
21
). 
26.3 Required utilities
 The well barrier performance is dependent on the availability of 
  uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS) and emergency power to activate or maintain well barriers 
upon loss 
of main electrical power during well operations
; 
 hydraulic 
supply including back
-up hydraulic accumulators for closure well valves
; 
 instrument 
air supply for critical equipment for securing wells
. 
26.4 Functional requirements
 Well integrity shall be ensured by 
at least two indepe
ndent and tested well barriers.
 In all well activities, the well barriers shall provide means for shutting in the well both
 during normal 
operations and in a well control situatio
n to avoid a blowout situation.
 All barrier elements shall
 be designed to function when exposed to maximum well pressure, flow, 
temperature, erosive or corrosive substances like CO
2, H2S and sand production during well life, normal 
operations and well control situations, e.g. to function exposed to high flow rate
s. All wells shall have a system for continuous monitoring of tubing pressure and temperature and of 
 A-
annulus pressure. In gas lift wells there shall be continuo
us monitoring of the B
-annulus.
 When selecting gas lift solutions, the risks related to annulus gas release shall be part of
 the decision 
process, ref. sub
clause
 5.6.3.3
. 
Automatic or manual activation of ESD
-shutdown levels can affect both of main
- 
and emergency power.
 The consequences of loss of main 
power during drilling and well intervention activities shall be evaluated

 to ensure that critical functions (emergency system consumers) are maintained during the emergency 
event.
 Typical drilling emergency systems consumers are: BOP control unit, instrument air supply, diesel 
transfer pump, drilling emergency circulation, drill pipe emergency hoisting, wireline grease pumps, etc. 

Reference is made to NORSOK D
-001.
 Function and equipment required to secure the well to avoid economical losses due to loss of 
main 
power, shou
ld have essential power supply.
 Reference is made to subclauses 
5.9
, 
clause
 11
 and
 clause
 15
 for additional well integrity related 
requirements.
 26.5 Survivab
ility
 requirements
 Well barrier elements shall resist the design accidental loads for the required period of time, e.g. 

BOP/safety head, control panels, hoses and connections, shall be protected against external loads like fire 
and explosion, dropped objec
ts and other mechanical impact. Well barriers shall also be able to h
andle 
well kill scenario loads.
 Well kill equipment shall be suitable for operation in a hazardous area zone 2 including protection such 

as ﬁflame arresterﬂ, overspeed control and ﬁspark 
arresterﬂ, ref.
 subclauses 
15.4.1
 and 
15.4.4
. 
It shall be possible to shut down BOP/safety head (secondary barrier) from at least two different and well 

separated loc
ations on the platform other than on the BOP/safety head control unit to ensure one is 
available during an accidental event (including influence of wind). In addition, for well intervention, the 

panels for manual control of the master valve and DHSV for the well in question, shall be located such that 
one is available during an accidental event typically along escape way to mustering point.
 Dry XMTs and wellheads shall as a minimum have fire resistance in accordance with NORSOK D

  Jack
-up Drilling Rig / Fixed Installation Constellations
 A.1
 Risk
- 
and fire analysis
 Concepts combining a jack
-up drilling rig and a fixed installation require special consideration and are
 discussed in Proactima / PSA report ﬁPS
-1071613
-RE-01 Prosjektrapport Brannbelastning ved boring 
over innretning i «cantilevermodusﬂ
 [4]
 for guidance.
 The following aspects shall be addressed:
  The major accidental risk for the
 fixed installation and the jack
-up rig operating in cantilever mode 
should be assessed considering the platforms as one entity
. 
 Layout and arrangement of the fixed installation should be developed with consideration of the 
effect of the jack
-up rig on 
ris
ks.
  Rig owners generic QRA does normally not address operation over a fixed installation, hence 

additional and site and installation specific risk assessments is required to ensure that the jack
-up 
rig can withstand the design accidental loads
. 
 Typical sce
narios that need to be addressed in the QRA(s) are:
 o blowout 
and well leaks at drill
 floor exposing derrick
; 
o blowout 
and well leaks in wellhead area on fixed installation exposing cantilever
; 
o ignited 
well
-/process leaks exposing jack
-up legs and hull
; 
o unign
ited 
gas leaks from the fixed installation exposing ventilation intakes and potential 
ignition sources on the jack
-up rig
; 
o blowout 
and well leaks due to well intervention
. 
 Ensure that relevant drilling competencies are involved in identifying possible leak
 locations and 
associated operations during HAZID, e.g:
 o number 
and location of leak points between wellhead and BOP
; 
o fire 
integrity of high pressure drilling riser
; 
o consequence 
of cantilever collapsing on drilling riser / BOP / wellhead
. 
 The effect on vent
ilation conditions on the fixed installation due to obstruction from the jack
-up 
hull should be taken into account.
  CFD and structural response analyses should be the basis for evaluations of consequences of 

derrick and cantilever collapse.
  Effect of openi
ngs in the weather deck / hatch deck should be evaluated with respect to leaks in 
adjacent areas, i.e. gas and liquid leaks and blowouts
. 
 Access ways between the jack
-up and the fixed installation are exposed to fire
- 
and explosion loads. 
If access is required for escape, specific impairment analysis is required.
 This assessment should be 
a part of the site specific QRA.
  In addition to fire
- 
and explosion hazards, ship collisions may require consideration since the 
installations may have different structura
l capacity
. 
 Relative movements of the two platforms should be considered when exposed to environmental 

and accidental loads, e.g. earthquake and collision loads, to ensure integrity of the well / drilling 
riser
. 
 The need for quick ignition source control o
n jack
-up due to large gas leaks on the fixed installation
. 
 Jack
-up diesel engines may have a large potential for igniting large gas clouds. Flame arrestors 
should be considered ref. subclause 
15.4.1
. 
 Falling objects and materi
al handling between installations
. 
 Location of 
atmospheric
 vents (on both installations)
. 
 Radiation from flares
. 
 Helicopter approach including helideck effects such as turbulence

 A.2
 Safety strategy and performance requirements
 A.2.1 Introduction
 A Safety Strategy 
needs to be developed for the simultaneous production and drilling (SIMOPS) phase 
ensuring that additional aspects relate to interface aspects. This is particularly rele
vant for the following 
systems:
  interaction 
between ESD systems
; 
 interaction 
between F&
G systems
; 
 public 
address (PA), alarm and emergency communication
; 
 active fire protection;
  evacuation 
& escape.
 The following clauses provide interface requirements related to clauses 
11
, 13
, 14
14
, 15
, 21
 and 
22
. 
A.2.2 ESD (
Clause 
11) 
ESD levels as defined in NORSOK S
-001 section 
11.4.3
 shall form the basis for the ESD interface 
philosophy. ESD levels defined for both fixed installations and MODUs may vary from the ESD levels 

specified in NORSOK S
-001, but should be converted to corresponding ESD levels defi
ned in
 NORSOK S
-001 to be comparable.
 The signals to be transferred between the fixed installation and the jack
-up rig shall be identified and 
documented, e.g.
 in area safety charts for the fixed installation.
 ESD signals for the ESD levels NORSOK APS, ESD1 and ESD2 shall be transferred from the host platf
orm to 
the MODU and vice versa.
 ESD levels at MODUs are typically initiated manually. Situations of hazard and accidents at the fixed 

installation shall not automatically initiate ESD at the MODU. Wells an
d activities at the drilling rig needs 
to be secured before init
iating ESD at the drilling rig.
 The highest ESD levels (corresponding to S
-001 APS and ESD1) at MODU should cause automatic 
activation of minimum lowest E
SD level at fixed installation.
 ESD activation shall initiate general alarm on both installations.
 A.2.3 Gas detection (Clause 
13)  Gas detection signals, including toxic gas detection if relevant, shall be transferred between fixed host 

installation and MODU. The signal
s should distinguish between ﬁlow gas alarmﬂ and ﬁhigh/confirmed gas 
alarmﬂ. 
Low gas alarm on either installation shall give local alarm in CCR / other relevant strategic locations and 
ignition source isolation in accordance with 
clause 
15
. Confirmed (ﬁhighﬂ) detection should follow the 
principles in
 Table 3
 in subclause 
14.4.5
. 
A.2.4 Fire detection (Clause 
14)  Fire detection signals shall be transferred between fixed host installation and MODU. The signals should 
distinguish between alarm and confirmed fire detection.

© 2018
 Fire alarm on either installation shall give local alarm in CCR / other relevant strategic locations. 
Confirmed fire detection shall
 initiate general alarm on the other installation. Confirmed fire detection in 
the drilling area shall initiate ESD2 on the fixed installation.
 A.2.5 Ignition source control (ISC) (Clause 
15) 
When connecting MODU to fixed host instal
lation, it should be evaluated if the constellation influences 
existing area classification at host platform and MODU. A specific area safety chart describing area 

classification for the co
-localization of i
nstallations shall be prepared.
 Consideration sho
uld be made to ventilation and combustion engine air intake
s with respect to gas 
exposure.
 Low gas alarm on either installation shall give local alarm in CCR / other relevant strategic locations and 

ignition source isolation in accordance with Clause 
15
. 
A.2.6 Public address (PA), alarm and emergency communication (Clause 
18) 
Control of personnel on board is required to ensure personnel control in an emergency situation 

including ensuring life boat capacity at both installations. The system may be manual or automatic 
personnel registration systems.
 A.2.7 Active 
fire 
protection (Clause 
21) 
The jack
-up rig should have sufficient fire water capacity, e.g. by use of fire water monitors, t
o cover the 
cantilever structure for fires from the fixed installation. Fire water may also be supplied from the f
ixed 
installation if available.
 A.2.8 Escape and evacuation (Clause 
22) 
If not required for escape, the access way betw
een the installations should use the requirements in 
clause 
22
 apart for the survivability requirements.
 The following lifeboat aspects should be assessed for the jack
-up rig:
  lifeboats 
height above sea level
; 
 lifeboats 
interac
tion with structures
; 
 inherent 
properties of davit launching lifeboat systems to ensure swift and safe lowering and 
release. 
The evaluation of davit launched lifeboat systems should cover all phases;
  lifeboat 
lowering
; 
 lifeboat 
landing
; 
 release 
of wire fal
ls; 
 sail 
away phase
.
